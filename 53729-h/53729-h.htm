<h3>PART FIRST.</h3>

<h4>Document No. 1.</h4>

<p class="hanging"><i>Paragraph from the “Illustrated London News,” published
under the head of “Obituary of Eminent
Persons,” in the issue of January 4th, 1879:</i></p>

<p class="center">SIR WILLIAM BEAUVOIR, BART.</p>

<p>Sir William Beauvoir, Bart., whose lamented death
has just occurred at Brighton, on December 28th, was
the head and representative of the junior branch of
the very ancient and honourable family of Beauvoir,
and was the only son of the late General Sir William
Beauvoir, Bart., by his wife Anne, daughter of Colonel
Doyle, of Chelsworth Cottage, Suffolk. He was born
in 1805, and was educated at Eton and Trinity Hall,
Cambridge. He was M. P. for Lancashire from 1837
to 1847, and was appointed a Gentleman of the Privy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Chamber in 1843. Sir William married, in 1826, Henrietta
Georgiana, fourth daughter of the Right Honourable
Adolphus Liddell, Q. C., by whom he had two sons,
William Beauvoir and Oliver Liddell Beauvoir. The
latter was with his lamented parent when he died. Of
the former nothing has been heard for nearly thirty
years, about which time he left England suddenly for
America. It is supposed that he went to California,
shortly after the discovery of gold. Much forgotten
gossip will now in all probability be revived, for the
will of the lamented baronet has been proved, on the
2d inst., and the personalty sworn under £70,000. The
two sons are appointed executors. The estate in Lancashire
is left to the elder, and the rest is divided
between the brothers. The doubt as to the career
of Sir William’s eldest son must now of course be
cleared up.</p>

<p>This family of Beauvoirs is of Norman descent, and
of great antiquity. This is the younger branch, founded
in the last century by Sir William Beauvoir, Bart.,
who was Chief Justice of the Canadas, whence he was
granted the punning arms and motto now borne by his
descendants&mdash;a beaver sable rampant on a field gules;
motto, “Damno.”</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Extract from the “Sunday Satirist”, a journal of high-life,
published in London, May 13th, 1848:</i></p>

<p>Are not our hereditary lawmakers and the members
of our old families the guardians of the honour of this
realm? One would not think so to see the reckless
gait at which some of them go down the road to ruin.
The D&mdash;&mdash;e of D&mdash;&mdash;m and the E&mdash;&mdash;l of B&mdash;&mdash;n and
L&mdash;&mdash;d Y&mdash;&mdash;g,&mdash;are not these pretty guardians of a
nation’s name? <i lang="la">Quis custodiet?</i> etc. Guardians,
forsooth, <i lang="fr">parce qu’ils se sont donnés la peine de
naître</i>! Some of the gentry make the running as well
as their betters. Young W&mdash;&mdash;m B&mdash;&mdash;r, son of old
Sir W&mdash;&mdash;m B&mdash;&mdash;r, late M.P. for L&mdash;&mdash;e, is a truly
model young man. He comes of a good old county
family&mdash;his mother was a daughter of the Right Honourable
A&mdash;&mdash;s L&mdash;&mdash;l, and he himself is old enough
to know better. But we hear of his escapades night
after night, and day after day. He bets all day and he
plays all night, and poor tired nature has to make the
best of it. And his poor worn purse gets the worst of
it. He has duns by the score. His I.O.U.’s are held
by every Jew in the city. He is not content with a
little gentlemanlike game of whist or <i lang="fr">écarté</i>, but he
must needs revive for his special use and behoof the
dangerous and well-nigh forgotten <i>pharaoh</i>. As luck
would have it, he had lost as much at this game of
brute chance as ever he would at any game of skill.
His judgment of horseflesh is no better than his luck
at cards. He came a cropper over the “Two Thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Guineas.” The victory of the favourite cost him to
the tune of over six thousand pounds. We learn that
he hopes to recoup himself on the Derby, by backing
Shylock for nearly nine thousand pounds; one bet was
twelve hundred guineas.</p>

<p>And this is the sort of man who may be chosen at
any time by force of family interest to make laws for
the toiling millions of Great Britain!</p>

<h4>Document No. 6.</h4>

<p class="hanging"><i>Extract from “Bell’s Life” of May 19th, 1848</i>:</p>

<p class="center">THE DERBY DAY.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wednesday.</span>&mdash;This day, like its predecessor, opened
with a cloudless sky, and the throng which crowded
the avenues leading to the grand scene of attraction
was, as we have elsewhere remarked, incalculable.</p>

<p class="center">THE DERBY.</p>

<p>The Derby Stakes of 50 sovs. each, h. ft. for three-year-olds;
colts, 8 st. 7 lb., fillies, 8 st. 2 lb.; the second
to receive 100 sovs., and the winner to pay 100 sovs.
towards police, etc.; mile and a half on the new
Derby course; 215 subs.</p>

<h4>Document No. 7.</h4>

<p class="hanging"><i>Paragraph of Shipping Intelligence from the “Liverpool
Courier” of June 21st, 1848</i>:</p>

<p>The bark <i>Euterpe</i>, Captain Riding, belonging to the
Transatlantic Clipper Line of Messrs. Judkins &amp; Cooke,
left the Mersey yesterday afternoon, bound for New
York. She took out the usual complement of steerage
passengers. The first officer’s cabin is occupied by
Professor Titus Peebles, M.R.C.S., M.R.G.S., lately
instructor in metallurgy at the University of Edinburgh,
and Mr. William Beauvoir. Professor Peebles,
we are informed, has an important scientific mission in
the States, and will not return for six months.</p>

<h4>Document No. 8.</h4>

<p class="hanging"><i>Paragraph from the “N. Y. Herald” of September
9th, 1848.</i></p>

<p>While we well know that the record of vice and
dissipation can never be pleasing to the refined tastes
of the cultivated denizens of the only morally pure
metropolis on the face of the earth, yet it may be of
interest to those who enjoy the fascinating study of
human folly and frailty to “point a moral or adorn
a tale” from the events transpiring in our very midst.
Such as these will view with alarm the sad example
afforded the youth of our city by the dissolute career
of a young lump of aristocratic affectation and patrician
profligacy, recently arrived in this city. This
young <em>gentleman’s</em> (save the mark!) name is Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
William F. Beauvoir, the latest scion of a venerable
and wealthy English family. We print the full name
of this beautiful exemplar of “haughty Albion,” although
he first appeared among our citizens under the
alias of Beaver, by which name he is now generally
known, although recorded on the books of the Astor
House by the name which our enterprise first gives to
the public. Lord Beauvoir’s career since his arrival
here has been one of unexampled extravagance and
mad immorality. His days and nights have been
passed in the gilded palaces of the fickle goddess,
Fortune, in Thomas Street and College Place, where
he has squandered fabulous sums, by some stated to
amount to over £78,000 sterling. It is satisfactory to
know that retribution has at last overtaken him. His
enormous income has been exhausted to the ultimate
farthing, and at latest accounts he had quit the city,
leaving behind him, it is shrewdly suspected, a large
hotel bill, though no such admission can be extorted
from his last landlord, who is evidently a sycophantic
adulator of British “aristocracy.”</p>

<h4>Document No. 10.</h4>

<p class="hanging"><i>Letter from the late John Phœnix, found among the
posthumous papers of the late John P. Squibob, and
promptly published in the “San Diego Herald.”</i></p>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Off the Coast of Florida</span>, Jan. 3, 1849.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Squib</span>:&mdash;I imagine your pathetic inquiry
as to my whereabouts&mdash;pathetic, not to say hypothetic&mdash;for
I am now where I cannot hear the dulcet
strains of your voice. I am on board ship. I am half
seas over. I am bound for California by way of the
Isthmus. I am going for the gold, my boy, the gold.
In the mean time I am lying around loose on the deck
of this magnificent vessel, the <i>Mercy G. Tarbox</i>, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Nantucket, bred by <i>Noah’s Ark</i> out of <i>Pilot-boat</i>, dam
by <i>Mudscow</i> out of <i>Raging Canawl</i>. The <i>Mercy G.
Tarbox</i> is one of the best boats of Nantucket, and
Captain Clearstarch is one of the best captains all
along shore&mdash;although, friend Squibob, I feel sure
that you are about to observe that a captain with a
name like that would give anyone the blues. But
don’t do it, Squib! Spare me this once.</p>

<p>But as a matter of fact this ultramarine joke of yours
is about east. It was blue on the <i>Mercy G.</i>&mdash;mighty
blue, too. And it needed the inspiring hope of the
gold I was soon to pick up in nuggets to stiffen my
backbone to a respectable degree of rigidity. I was
about ready to wilt. But I discovered two Englishmen
on board, and now I get along all right. We
have formed a little temperance society&mdash;just we
three, you know&mdash;to see if we cannot, by a course of
sampling and severe study, discover which of the captain’s
liquors is most dangerous, so that we can take
the pledge not to touch it. One of them is a chemist
or a metallurgist, or something scientific. The other
is a gentleman.</p>

<p>The chemist or metallurgist or something scientific
is Professor Titus Peebles, who is going out to prospect
for gold. He feels sure that his professional
training will give him the inside track in the gulches
and gold mines. He is a smart chap. He invented
the celebrated “William Riley Baking Powder”&mdash;bound
to rise up every time.</p>

<p>And here I must tell you a little circumstance. As
I was coming down to the dock in New York, to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
aboard the <i>Mercy G.</i>, a small boy was walloping a boy
still smaller; so I made peace, and walloped them both.
And then they both began heaving rocks at me&mdash;one
of which I caught dexterously in the dexter hand.
Yesterday, as I was pacing the deck with the professor,
I put my hand in my pocket and found this stone. So
I asked the professor what it was.</p>

<p>He looked at it and said it was gneiss.</p>

<p>“Is it?” said I. “Well, if a small but energetic
youth had taken you on the back of the head with it,
you would not think it so nice!”</p>

<p>And then, O Squib, he set out to explain that he
meant “gneiss,” not “nice!” The ignorance of these
English about a joke is really wonderful. It is easy
to see that they have never been brought up on them.
But perhaps there was some excuse for the professor
that day, for he was the president <i lang="la">pro tem.</i> of our projected
temperance society, and as such he had been
making a quantitative and qualitative analysis of another
kind of quartz.</p>

<p>So much for the chemist or metallurgist or something
scientific. The gentleman and I get on better. His
name is Beaver, which he persists in spelling Beauvoir.
Ridiculous, isn’t it? How easy it is to see that the
English have never had the advantage of a good
common-school education&mdash;so few of them can spell.
Here’s a man don’t know how to spell his own name.
And this shows how the race over there on the little
island is degenerating. It was not so in other days.
Shakspere, for instance, not only knew how to spell
his own name, but&mdash;and this is another proof of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
superiority to his contemporaries&mdash;he could spell it in
half a dozen different ways.</p>

<p>This Beaver is a clever fellow, and we get on first
rate together. He is going to California for gold&mdash;like
the rest of us. But I think he has had his share&mdash;and
spent it. At any rate he has not much now.
I have been teaching him poker, and I am afraid he
won’t have any soon. I have an idea he has been
going pretty fast&mdash;and mostly down hill. But he
has his good points. He is a gentleman all through,
as you can see. Yes, friend Squibob, even you could
see right through him. We are all going to California
together, and I wonder which one of the three will
turn up trumps first&mdash;Beaver, or the chemist,
metallurgist or something scientific, or</p>

not interesting. Just reflect on my surroundings. Besides,
the interest will accumulate a good while before
you get the missive. And I don’t know how you ever

on the Isthmus the mails are as uncertain as the females

<p>William Beaver, better known ten years ago as
“Beaver Bill,” is now a quiet and prosperous agriculturalist
in the Steal Valley. He was, however, a
pioneer in the 1849 movement, and a vivid memory of
this fact at times moves him to quit his bucolic labors
and come in town for a real old-fashioned tare. He
arrived in New Centreville during Christmas week;
and got married suddenly, but not unexpectedly, yesterday
morning. His friends took it upon themselves
to celebrate the joyful occasion, rare in the experience
of at least one of the parties, by getting very high on
Irish Ike’s whiskey and serenading the newly-married
couple with fish-horns, horse-fiddles, and other improvised
musical instruments. Six of the participators in
this epithalamial serenade, namely, José Tanco, Hiram
Scuttles, John P. Jones, Hermann Bumgardner, Jean
Durant (“Frenchy”), and Bernard McGinnis (“Big
Barney”), were taken in tow by the police force, assisted
by citizens, and locked up over night, to cool their generous
enthusiasm in the gloomy dungeons of Justice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>

with a reprimand, except Big Barney and José Tanco,

<p>Great uneasiness exists all along the Indian frontier.
Nearly all the regular troops have been withdrawn from
the West for service in the South. With the return
of the warm weather it seems certain that the red skins
will take advantage of the opportunity thus offered,
and inaugurate a bitter and vindictive fight against the
whites. Rumors come from the agencies that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Indians are leaving in numbers. A feverish excitement
among them has been easily to be detected.
Their ponies are now in good condition, and forage
can soon be had in abundance on the prairie, if it is not
already. Everything points toward a sudden and
startling outbreak of hostilities.</p>

<p class="center">[SPECIAL DESPATCH TO THE NEW YORK HERALD.]</p>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">St. Paul</span>, June 22, 1861.</p>

<p>The Sioux near here are all in a ferment. Experienced
Indian fighters say the signs of a speedy going
on the war-path are not to be mistaken. No one can
tell how soon the whole frontier may be in a bloody
blaze. The women and children are rapidly coming in
from all exposed settlements. Nothing overt as yet
has transpired, but that the Indians will collide very
soon with the settlers is certain. All the troops have
been withdrawn. In our defenceless state there is no
knowing how many lives may be lost before the regiments
of volunteers now organizing can take the field.</p>

night, and did much damage before the surprised settlers
rallied and drove them off. The red skins met
with heavy losses. Among the whites killed are a man
named William Beaver, sometimes called Beaver Bill,
and his wife. Their child, a beautiful little girl of two,
was carried off by the red rascals. A party has been
made up to pursue them. Owing to their taking their
wounded with them, the trail is very distinct.</p>

more, certain. I didn’t like to mention it when I wrote
you last, but things were very queer after we left
Denver, and “Treasury” was a mockery till we got to
Bluefoot Springs, which is a mining town, where we
showed in the hotel dining-room. Then there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
strike just before the curtain went up. The house was
mostly miners in red shirts and very exacting. The
sinews were forthcoming very quick my dear, and after
that the ghost walked quite regular. So now everything
is bright, and you won’t have to worry if Chicago
doesn’t do the right thing by you.</p>

<p>I don’t find this engagement half as disagreeable as
I expected. Of course it ain’t so very nice travelling
in a combination with variety talent but they keep to
themselves and we regular professionals make a <em>happy
family</em> that Barnum would not be ashamed of and
quite separate and comfortable. We don’t associate
with any of them only with The Unique Mulligans
wife, because he beats her. So when he is on a regular
she sleeps with me.</p>

<p>And talking of liquor dear old man, if you knew
how glad and proud I was to see you writing so
straight and steady and beautiful in your three last
letters. O, I’m sure my darling if the boys thought of
the little wife out on the road they wouldn’t plague
you so with the Enemy. Tell Harry Atkinson this
from me, he has a good kind heart but he is the worst
of your friends. Every night when I am dressing I
think of you at Chicago, and pray you may never
again go on the way you did that terrible night at
Rochester. Tell me dear, did you look handsome in
Horatio? You ought to have had Laertes instead of
that duffing Merivale.</p>

<p>And now I have the queerest thing to tell you.
Jardine is going in for Indians and has secured six
very ugly ones. I mean real Indians, not professional.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
They are hostile Comanshies or something who have
just laid down their arms. They had an insurrection
in the first year of the War, when the troops went
East, and they killed all the settlers and ranches and
destroyed the canyons somewhere out in Nevada, and
when they were brought here they had a wee little kid
with them only four or five years old, but <em>so sweet</em>.
They stole her and killed her parents and brought her
up for their own in the cunningest little moccasins.
She could not speak a word of English except her own
name which is Nina. She has blue eyes and all her
second teeth. The ladies here made a great fuss about
her and sent her flowers and worsted afgans, but they
did not do anything else for her and left her to us.</p>

<p>O dear old man you must let me have her! You
never refused me a thing yet and she is so like our
Avonia Marie that my heart almost breaks when she
puts her arms around my neck&mdash;<em>she calls me mamma
already</em>. I want to have her with us when we get the
little farm&mdash;and it must be near, that little farm of
ours&mdash;we have waited for it so long&mdash;and something
tells me my own old faker will make his hit soon and
be great. You can’t tell how I have loved it and
hoped for it and how real every foot of that farm is to
me. And though I can never see my own darling’s
face among the roses it will make me so happy to see
this poor dead mother’s pet get red and rosy in the
country air. And till the farm comes we shall always
have enough for her, without your ever having to black
up again as you did for me the winter I was sick my
own poor boy!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Write me yes&mdash;you will be glad when you see her.
And now love and regards to Mrs. Barry and all friends.
Tell the Worst of Managers that he knows where to
find his leading juvenile for next season. Think how
funny it would be for us to play together next year&mdash;we
haven’t done it since ’57&mdash;the third year we were

to Messrs. Hitchcock and Van Rensselaer,
Attorneys and Counsellors at Law, 76 Broadway,

<p class="date">January 8, 1879.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Messrs. Hitchcock &amp; Van Rensselaer</span>:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>: On the death of our late client, Sir
William Beauvoir, Bart., and after the reading of the
deceased gentleman’s will, drawn up nearly forty years
ago by our Mr. Dick, we were requested by Oliver
Beauvoir, Esq., the second son of the late Sir William,
to assist him in discovering and communicating with
his elder brother, the present Sir William Beauvoir,
of whose domicile we have little or no information.</p>

<p>After a consultation between Mr. Oliver Beauvoir
and our Mr. Dick, it was seen that the sole knowledge
in our possession amounted substantially to this:
Thirty years ago the elder son of the late baronet,
after indulging in dissipation in every possible form,
much to the sorrow of his respected parent, who frequently
expressed as much to our Mr. Dick, disappeared,
leaving behind him bills and debts of all descriptions,
which we, under instructions from Sir William, examined,
audited, and paid. Sir William Beauvoir would
allow no search to be made for his erring son and
would listen to no mention of his name. Current<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
gossip declared that he had gone to New York, where
he probably arrived about midsummer, 1848. Mr.
Oliver Beauvoir thinks that he crossed to the States
in company with a distinguished scientific gentleman,
Professor Titus Peebles. Within a year after his
departure news came that he had gone to California
with Professor Peebles; this was about the time gold
was discovered in the States. That the present Sir
William Beauvoir did about this time actually arrive
on the Pacific Coast in company with the distinguished
scientific man above mentioned, we have every reason
to believe: we have even direct evidence on the subject.
A former junior clerk, who had left us at about the
same period as the disappearance of the elder son of
our late client, accosted our Mr. Dick when the latter
was in Paris last summer, and informed him (our Mr.
Dick) that he (the former junior clerk) was now a
resident of Nevada and a member of Congress for that
county, and in the course of conversation he mentioned
that he had seen Professor Peebles and the son
of our late client in San Francisco, nearly thirty years
ago. Other information we have none. It ought not
to be difficult to discover Professor Peebles, whose
scientific attainments have doubtless ere this been duly
recognized by the U. S. government. As our late
client leaves the valuable family estate in Lancashire
to his elder son and divides the remainder equally
between his two sons, you will readily see why we
invoke your assistance in discovering the present domicile
of the late baronet’s elder son, or, in default thereof,
in placing in our hand such proof of his death as may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
be necessary to establish that lamentable fact in our
probate court.</p>

<p>We have the honour to remain, as ever, your most
humble and obedient servants,</p>

<p class="signature"><span class="smcap">Throstlethwaite, Throstlethwaite, &amp; Dick</span>.</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;Our late client’s grandson, Mr. William
Beauvoir, the only child of Oliver Beauvoir, Esq., is
now in the States, in Chicago or Nebraska or somewhere
in the West. We shall be pleased if you can
keep him informed as to the progress of your investigations.
Our Mr. Dick has requested Mr. Oliver
Beauvoir to give his son your address, and to suggest
his calling on you as he passes through New York on
his way home.</p>

all in your power to aid us in the search for the missing
Englishman. From the letter of Messrs. Throstlethwaite,
Throstlethwaite, and Dick, it seems extremely
probable, not to say certain, that Mr. Beauvoir arrived
in your city about 1849, in company with a distinguished
English scientist, Professor Titus Peebles,
whose professional attainments were such that he is
probably well known, if not in California, at least in
some other of the mining States. The first thing to
be done, therefore, it seems to us, is to ascertain the
whereabouts of the professor, and to interview him at
once. It may be that he has no knowledge of the
present domicile of Mr. William Beauvoir, in which
case we shall rely on you to take such steps as, in your
judgment, will best conduce to a satisfactory solution
of the mystery. In any event, please look up Professor
Peebles, and interview him at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>: Your favor of the 31st ult., forwarded
me from San Francisco, has been duly rec’d, and contents
thereof noted.</p>

<p>My time is at present so fully occupied by my duties
as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention that I
can only jot down a brief report of my recollections on
this head. When I return to S. F., I shall be happy
to give you any further information that may be in my
possession.</p>

<p>The person concerning whom you inquire was my
fellow passenger on my first voyage to this State on
board the <i>Mercy G. Tarbox</i>, in the latter part of the
year. He was then known as Mr. William Beauvoir.
I was acquainted with his history, of which the details
escape me at this writing. He was a countryman of
mine; a member of an important county family&mdash;Devonian,
I believe&mdash;and had left England on account
of large gambling debts, of which he confided to me the
exact figure. I believe they totted up something like
£14,500.</p>

<p>I had at no time a very intimate acquaintance with
Mr. Beauvoir; during our sojourn on the <i>Tarbox</i> he
was the chosen associate of a depraved and vicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
character named Phœnix. I am not averse from saying
that I was then a member of a profession rather different
to my present one, being, in fact, professor of
metallurgy, and I saw much less, at that period, of Mr.
B. than I probably should now.</p>

<p>Directly we landed at S. F., the object of your
inquiries set out for the gold region, without adequate
preparation, like so many others did at that time, and,
I heard, fared very ill.</p>

<p>I encountered him some six months later; I have
forgotten precisely in what locality, though I have a
faint impression that his then habitat was some cañon
or ravine deriving its name from certain osseous
deposits. Here he had engaged in the business of
gold-mining, without, perhaps, sufficient grounds for
any confident hope of ultimate success. I have his
I. O. U. for the amount of my fee for assaying several
specimens from his claim, said specimens being all iron
pyrites.</p>

<p>This is all I am able to call to mind at present in the
matter of Mr. Beauvoir. I trust his subsequent career
was of a nature better calculated to be satisfactory to
himself; but his mineralogical knowledge was but
superficial; and his character was sadly deformed by
a fatal taste for low associates.</p>

<p>I remain, gentlemen, your very humble and obd’t
servant,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Miss Nina Saville appeared last night at the Mendocino
Grand Opera House, in her unrivalled specialty of <cite>Winona, the
Child of the Prairies</cite>; supported by Tompkins and Frobisher’s
Grand Stellar Constellation. Although Miss Saville has long
been known as one of the most promising of California’s younger
tragediennes, we feel safe in saying that the impression she produced
upon the large and cultured audience gathered to greet
her last night stamped her as one of the greatest and most phenomenal
geniuses of our own or other times. Her marvellous
beauty of form and feature, added to her wonderful artistic
power, and her perfect mastery of the difficult science of clog-dancing,
won her an immediate place in the hearts of our citizens,
and confirmed the belief that California need no longer
look to Europe or Chicago for dramatic talent of the highest
order. The sylph-like beauty, the harmonious and ever-varying
grace, the vivacity and the power of the young artist who made
her maiden effort among us last night, prove conclusively that
the virgin soil of California teems with yet undiscovered fires of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
genius. The drama of <cite>Winona, the Child of the Prairies</cite>, is a
pure, refined, and thoroughly absorbing entertainment, and has
been pronounced by the entire press of the country equal to if
not superior to the fascinating <cite>Lady of Lyons</cite>. It introduces
all the favorites of the company in new and original characters,
and with its original music, which is a prominent feature, has
already received over 200 representations in the principal cities
in the country. It abounds in effective situations, striking tableaux,
and a most quaint and original concert entitled ‘The
Mule Fling,’ which alone is worth the price of admission. As
this is the first presentation in this city, the theatre will no
doubt be crowded, and seats should be secured early in the day.
The drama will be preceded by that prince of humorists, Mr.
Billy Barker, in his humorous sketches and pictures from life.”</p>

</div>

<p>We quote the above from our esteemed contemporary,
the Mendocino <cite>Gazette</cite>, at the request of Mr. Zeke
Kilburn, Miss Saville’s advance agent, who has still
further appealed to us, not only on the ground of our
common humanity, but as the only appreciative and
thoroughly informed critics on the Pacific Slope to
“endorse” this rather vivid expression of opinion.
Nothing will give us greater pleasure. Allowing for
the habitual enthusiasm of our northern neighbor, and
for the well-known chaste aridity of Mendocino in
respect of female beauty, we have no doubt that Miss
Nina Saville is all that the fancy, peculiarly opulent
and active even for an advance agent, of Mr. Kilburn
has painted her, and is quite such a vision of youth,
beauty, and artistic phenomenality as will make the
stars of Paris and Illinois pale their ineffectual fires.</p>

<p>Miss Saville will appear in her “unrivalled specialty”
at Hank’s New Centreville Opera House, to-morrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
night, as may be gathered, in a general way, from an
advertisement in another column.</p>

<p>We should not omit to mention that Mr. Zeke Kilburn,
Miss Saville’s advance agent, is a gentleman of
imposing presence, elegant manners, and complete
knowledge of his business. This information may be
relied upon as at least authentic, having been derived
from Mr. Kilburn himself, to which we can add, as our
own contribution, the statement that Mr. Kilburn is a
gentleman of marked liberality in his ideas of spirituous
refreshments, and of equal originality in his conception
of the uses, objects and personal susceptibilities
of the journalistic profession.</p>

<h4>Document No. 27.</h4>

<p class="hanging"><i>Extract from the New Centreville [late Dead Horse]
“Gazette and Courier of Civilization,” Dec. 24th,
1878.</i></p>

<p>A little while ago, in noting the arrival of Miss Nina
Saville of the New Centreville Opera House, we quoted
rather extensively from our esteemed contemporary,
the Mendocino <cite>Times</cite>, and commented upon the quotation.
Shortly afterwards, it may also be remembered,
we made a very direct and decided apology for
the sceptical levity which inspired those remarks, and
expressed our hearty sympathy with the honest, if
somewhat effusive, enthusiasm with which the dramatic
critic of Mendocino greeted the sweet and dainty little
girl who threw over the dull, weary old business of the
stage “sensation” the charm of a fresh and childlike
beauty and originality, as rare and delicate as those
strange, unreasonable little glimmers of spring sunsets
that now and then light up for a brief moment the
dull skies of winter evenings, and seem to have
strayed into ungrateful January out of sheer pity for
the sad earth.</p>

<p>Mendocino noticed the facts that form the basis of
the above meteorological simile, and we believe we
gave Mendocino full credit for it at the time. We
refer to the matter at this date only because in our
remarks of a few days ago we had occasion to mention
the fact of the existence of Mr. Zeke Kilburn, an advance
agent, who called upon us at the time, to endeavor
to induce us, by means apparently calculated more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
closely for the latitude of Mendocino, to extend to
Miss Saville, before her appearance, the critical approbation
which we gladly extended after. This little
item of interest we alluded to at the time, and furthermore
intimated, with some vagueness, that there existed
in Mr. Kilburn’s character a certain misdirected zeal
which, combined with a too keen artistic appreciation,
are apt to be rather dangerous stock-in-trade for an
advance agent.</p>

<p>It was twenty-seven minutes past two o’clock yesterday
afternoon. The chaste white mystery of Shigo
Mountain was already taking on a faint, almost imperceptible
hint of pink, like the warm cheek of a girl
who hears a voice and anticipates a blush. Yet the
rays of the afternoon sun rested with undiminished
radiance on the empty pork-barrel in front of McMullin’s
shebang. A small and vagrant infant, whose
associations with empty barrels were doubtless hitherto
connected solely with dreams of saccharine dissipation,
approached the bunghole with precocious caution, and
retired with celerity and a certain acquisition of experience.
An unattached goat, a martyr to the radical
theory of personal investigation, followed in the footsteps
of infantile humanity, retired with even greater
promptitude, and was fain to stay its stomach on a
presumably empty rend-rock can, afterward going into
seclusion behind McMullin’s horse-shed, before the
diuretic effect of tin flavored with blasting-powder
could be observed by the attentive eye of science.</p>

<p>Mr. Kilburn emerged from the hostelry of McMullin.
Mr. Kilburn, as we have before stated at his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
request, is a gentleman of imposing presence. It is
well that we made this statement when we did, for it
is hard to judge of the imposing quality in a gentleman’s
presence when that gentleman is suspended
from the arm of another gentleman by the collar of
the first gentleman’s coat. The gentleman in the rear
of Mr. Kilburn was Mr. William Beauvoir, a young
Englishman in a check suit. Mr. Beauvoir is not avowedly
a man of imposing presence; he wears a seal ring,
and he is generally a scion of an effete oligarchy, but
he has, since his introduction into this community,
behaved himself, to use the adjectivial adverb of Mr.
McMullin, <em>white</em>, and he has a very remarkable biceps.
These qualities may hereafter enhance his popularity
in New Centreville.</p>

<p>Mr. Beauvoir’s movements, at twenty-seven minutes
past two yesterday afternoon, were few and simple.
He doubled Mr. Kilburn up, after the fashion of an
ordinary jack-knife, and placed him in the barrel, wedge-extremity
first, remarking, as he did so, “She is, is
she?” He then rammed Mr. Kilburn carefully home,
and put the cover on.</p>

<p>We learn to-day that Mr. Kilburn has resumed his
professional duties on the road.</p>

<h4>Document No. 28.</h4>

<p class="hanging"><i>Account of the same event from the New Centreville
“Standard,” December 24th, 1878.</i></p>

<p>It seems strange that even the holy influences which
radiate from this joyous season cannot keep some men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
from getting into unseemly wrangles. It was only
yesterday that our local saw a street row here in the
quiet avenues of our peaceful city&mdash;a street row
recalling the riotous scenes which took place here
before Dead Horse experienced a change of heart and
became New Centreville. Our local succeeded in gathering
all the particulars of the affray, and the following
statement is reliable. It seems that Mr. Kilburn, the
gentlemanly and affable advance agent of the Nina
Saville Dramatic Company, now performing at Andy
Hanks’ Opera House to big houses, was brutally assaulted
by a ruffianly young Englishman, named Beauvoir,
for no cause whatever. We say for no cause, as
it is obvious that Mr. Kilburn, as the agent of the
troupe, could have said nothing against Miss Saville
which an outsider, not to say a foreigner like Mr.
Beauvoir, had any call to resent. Mr. Kilburn is a
gentleman unaccustomed to rough-and-tumble encounters,
while his adversary has doubtless associated more
with pugilists than gentlemen&mdash;at least anyone would
think so from his actions yesterday. Beauvoir hustled
Mr. Kilburn out of Mr. Mullin’s, where the unprovoked
assault began, and violently shook him across the new
plank sidewalk. The person by the name of Clark,
whom Judge Jones for some reason now permits to
edit the moribund but once respectable <cite>Gazette</cite>, caught
the eye of the congenial Beauvoir, and, true to the
ungentlemanly instincts of his base nature, pointed to
a barrel in the street. The brutal Englishman took the
hint and thrust Mr. Kilburn forcibly into the barrel,
leaving the vicinity before Mr. Kilburn, emerging from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
his close quarters, had fully recovered. What the ruffianly
Beauvoir’s motive may have been for this wanton
assault it is impossible to say; but it is obvious to all
why this fellow Clark sought to injure Mr. Kilburn, a
gentleman whose many good qualities he of course fails
to appreciate. Mr. Kilburn, recognizing the acknowledged
merits of our job-office, had given us the contract
for all the printing he needed in New Centreville.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Letter from Nina Saville to William Beauvoir.</i></p>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">New Centreville</span>, December 26, 1878.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Beauvoir</span>&mdash;I was very sorry to receive
your letter of yesterday&mdash;<em>very</em> sorry&mdash;because
there can be only one answer that I can make&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
you might well have spared me the pain of saying the
word&mdash;No. You ask me if I love you. If I did&mdash;do
you think it would be true love in me to tell you so,
when I know what it would cost you? Oh indeed you
must never marry <em>me</em>! In your own country you would
never have heard of me&mdash;never seen me&mdash;surely never
written me such a letter to tell me that you love me
and want to marry me. It is not that I am ashamed
of my business or of the folks around me, or ashamed
that I am only the charity child of two poor players,
who lived and died working for the bread for
their mouths and mine. I am proud of them&mdash;yes,
proud of what they did and suffered for one poorer
than themselves&mdash;a little foundling out of an Indian
camp. But I know the difference between you and
me. You are a great man at home&mdash;you have never
told me how great&mdash;but I know your father is a rich
lord, and I suppose you are. It is not that I think <em>you</em>
care for that, or think less of me because I was born
different from you. I know how good&mdash;how kind&mdash;how
<em>respectful</em> you have always been to me&mdash;<em>my lord</em>&mdash;and
I shall never forget it&mdash;for a girl in my position
knows well enough how you might have been
otherwise. Oh believe me&mdash;<em>my true friend</em>&mdash;I am
never going to forget all you have done for me&mdash;and
how good it has been to have you near me&mdash;a man so
different from most others&mdash;I don’t mean only the
kind things you have done&mdash;the books and the thoughts
and the ways you have taught me to enjoy&mdash;and all
the trouble you have taken to make me something better
than the stupid little girl I was when you found me&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
a great deal more than that&mdash;the consideration
you have had for me and for what I hold best in the
world. I had never met a <em>gentleman</em> before&mdash;and
now the first one I meet&mdash;he is my <em>friend</em>. That is a
great deal.</p>

<p>Only think of it! You have been following me
around now for three months, and I have been weak
enough to allow it. I am going to do the right thing
now. You may think it hard in me <em>if you really mean
what you say</em>, but even if everything else were right, I
would not marry you&mdash;because of your rank. I do
not know how things are at your home&mdash;but something
tells me it would be wrong and that your family
would have a right to hate you and never forgive you.
Professionals cannot go in your society. And that is
even if I loved you&mdash;and I do not love you&mdash;I do
not love you&mdash;<em>I do not love you</em>&mdash;now I have written
it you will believe it.</p>

<p>So now it is ended&mdash;I am going back to the line
I was first in&mdash;variety&mdash;and with a new name. So
you can never find me&mdash;I entreat you&mdash;I beg of you&mdash;not
to look for me. If you only put your mind to
it&mdash;you will find it so easy to forget me&mdash;for I will
not do you the wrong to think that you did not mean
what you wrote in your letter or what you said that
night <em>when we sang Annie Laurie together</em> the last
time.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Letter from Cable J. Dexter, Esq., to Messrs. Pixley
and Sutton, San Francisco.</i></p>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">New Centreville, Cal.</span>, March 3, 1879.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Messrs. Pixley &amp; Sutton</span>:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gents</span>: I am happy to report that I have at last
reached the bottom level in the case of William Beaver,
<i>alias</i> Beaver Bill, deceased through Indians in 1861.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>In accordance with your instructions and check, I
proceeded, on the 10th ult., to Shawgum Creek, when
I interviewed Blue Horse, chief of the Comanches, who
tomahawked subject of your inquiries in the year above
mentioned. Found the Horse in the penitentiary,
serving out a drunk and disorderly. Though belligerent
at date aforesaid, Horse is now tame, though intemperate.
Appeared unwilling to converse, and required
stimulants to awaken his memory. Please find
enclosed memo. of account for whiskey, covering extra
demijohn to corrupt jailer. Horse finally stated that
he personally let daylight through deceased, and is
willing to guarantee thoroughness of decease. Stated
further that aforesaid Beaver’s family consisted of
squaw and kid. Is willing to swear that squaw was
killed, the tribe having no use for her. Killing done
by Mule-Who-Goes-Crooked, personal friend of Horse’s.
The minor child was taken into camp and kept until
December of 1863, when tribe dropped to howling cold
winter and went on government reservation. Infant
(female) was then turned over to U. S. Government
at Fort Kearney.</p>

<p>I posted to last-named locality on the 18th ult., and
found by the quartermaster’s books that, no one appearing
to claim the kid, she had been duly indentured,
together with six Indians, to a man by the name of
Guardine or Sardine (probably the latter), in the show
business. The Indians were invoiced as Sage Brush
Jimmy, Boiling Hurricane, Mule-Who-Goes-Crooked,
Joe, Hairy Grasshopper and Dead Polecat. Child
known as White Kitten. Receipt for Indians was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
signed by Mr. Hi. Samuels, who is still in the circus
business, and whom I happen to be selling out at this
moment, at suit of McCullum &amp; Montmorency, former
partners. Samuels positively identified kid with variety
specialist by name of Nina Saville, who has been
showing all through this region for a year past.</p>

<p>I shall soon have the pleasure of laying before you
documents to establish the complete chain of evidence,
from knifing of original subject of your inquiries right
up to date.</p>

<p>I have to-day returned from New Centreville, whither
I went after Miss Saville. Found she had just skipped
the town with a young Englishman by the name of
Bovoir, who had been paying her polite attentions for
some time, having bowied or otherwise squelched a man
for her within a week or two. It appears the young
woman had refused to have anything to do with him
for a long period; but he seems to have struck pay
gravel about two days before my arrival. At present,
therefore, the trail is temporarily lost; but I expect
to fetch the couple if they are anywhere this side of
the Rockies.</p>

<p>Awaiting your further instructions, and cash backing
thereto, I am, gents, very resp’y yours,</p>

<span class="smaller">IN THE OLD WORLD.</span></h3>

<p>They had been to the Lido for a short swim in
the slight but bracing surf of the Adriatic. They
had had a mid-day breakfast in a queer little restaurant,
known only to the initiated, and therefore early discovered
by Larry, who had a keen scent for a cook
learned in the law. They had loitered along the Riva
degli Schiavoni, looking at a perambulatory puppet-show,
before which a delighted audience sturdily disregarded
the sharp wind which bravely fluttered the
picturesque tatters of the spectators; and they were
moved to congratulate the Venetians on their freedom
from the monotonous repertory of the Anglo-American
Punch and Judy, which consists solely of a play really
unique in the exact sense of that much-abused word.
They were getting their fill of the delicious Italian art
which is best described by an American verb&mdash;to loaf.
And yet they were not wont to be idle, and they had
both the sharp, quick American manner, on which laziness
sits uneasily and infrequently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>John Manning and Laurence Laughton were both
young New Yorkers. Larry&mdash;for so in youth was he
called by everybody pending the arrival of years which
should make him a universal uncle, to be known of all
men as “Uncle Larry”&mdash;was as pleasant a travelling
companion as one could wish. He was the only son
and heir of a father, now no more, but vaguely understood
when alive and in the flesh to have been “in the
China trade;” although whether this meant crockery
or Cathay no one was able with precision to declare.
Larry Laughton had been graduated from Columbia
College with the class of 1860, and the following spring
found him here in Venice after a six months’ ramble
through Europe with his old friend, John Manning,
partly on foot and partly in an old carriage of their
own, in which they enjoyed the fast-vanishing pleasures
of posting.</p>

<p>John Manning was a little older than Larry; he had
left West Point in 1854 with a commission as second
lieutenant in the Old Dragoons. For nearly six years
he did his duty in that state of life in which it pleased
the Secretary of War and General Scott to call him;
he had crossed the plains one bleak winter to a post in
the Rocky Mountains, and he had danced through two
summers at Fort Adams at Newport; he had been
stationed for a while in New Mexico, where there was
an abundance of the pleasant sport of Indian-fighting,&mdash;even
now he had only to make believe a little to see
the tufted head of a Navajo peer around the columns
supporting the Lion of Saint Mark, or to mistake the
fringe of <i lang="it">facchini</i> on the edge of the Grand Canal for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
a group of the shiftless half-breeds of New Mexico. In
time the Old Dragoons had been ordered North, where
the work was then less pleasant than on the border;
and, in fact, it was a distinct unwillingness to execute
the Fugitive Slave Law which forced John Manning to
resign his commission in the army, although it was the
hanging of John Brown which drew from him the
actual letter of resignation. Before settling down to
other work&mdash;for he was a man who could not and
would not be idle&mdash;he had gratified his long desire of
taking a turn through the Old World. Larry Laughton
had joined him in Holland, where he had been making
researches into the family history, and proving to his
own satisfaction at least that the New York Mannings,
in spite of their English name, had come from Amsterdam
to New Amsterdam. And now, toward the end
of April, 1861, John Manning and Laurence Laughton
stood on the Rialto, hesitating <i lang="it">Fra Marco e Todaro</i>,
as the Venetians have it, in uninterested question
whether they should go into the Ghetto, among the
hideous homes of the chosen people, or out again to
Murano for a second visit to the famous factory of
Venetian glass.</p>

<p>“I say, John,” remarked Larry as they lazily debated
the question, gazing meanwhile on the steady succession
of gondolas coming and going to and from the steps by
the side of the bridge, “I’d as lief, if not liefer, go to
Murano again, if they’ve any of their patent anti-poison
goblets left. You know they say they used to make a
glass so fine that it was shattered into shivers whenever
poison might be poured into it. Of course I don’t believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
it, but a glass like that would be mighty handy
in the sample-rooms of New York. I’m afraid a man
walking up Broadway could use up a gross of the anti-poison
goblets before he got one straight drink of the
genuine article, unadulterated and drawn from the
wood.”</p>

<p>“You must not make fun of a poetic legend, Larry.
You have to believe everything over here, or you do
not get the worth of your money,” said John Manning.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know,” was Larry’s reply; “I don’t
know just what to believe. I was talking about it last
night at Florian’s, while you were writing letters home.”</p>

<p>“I did not know Mr. Laughton had friends in Venice.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can make friends anywhere. And this one
was lots of fun. He was a priest, an <i lang="it">abbate</i>, I think he
calls himself. He had read five newspapers in the
<i lang="it">caffè</i> and paid for one tiny cup of coffee. When I
finished the <i lang="fr">Débats</i> I passed it to him for his sixth&mdash;and
he spoke to me in French, and I wasn’t going to
let an Italian talk French to me without answering
back, so I just sailed in and began to swap stories with
him.”</p>

<p>“No doubt you gave him much valuable information.”</p>

<p>“Well, I did; I just exuded information. Why the
first thing he said, when I told him I was an American,
was to wonder whether I hadn’t met his brother, who
was also in America&mdash;in Rio Janeiro&mdash;just as if Rio
was the other side of the North River.”</p>

<p>John Manning smiled at Larry’s disgusted expression,
and asked, “What has this <i lang="it">abbate</i> to do with the
fragile Venetian glass?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“Only this,” answered Larry. “I told him two or
three Northwesters, just as well as I could in French,
and then he said that marvellous things were also done
here once upon a time. And he told me about the
glass which broke when poison was poured into it.”</p>

<p>“It is a pleasant superstition,” said John Manning.
“I think Poe makes use of it, and I believe Shakespeare
refers to it.”</p>

<p>“But did either Poe or Shakespeare say anything
about the two goblets just alike, made for the twin
brothers Manin nearly four hundred years ago? Did
they tell you how one glass was shivered by poison and
its owner killed, and how the other brother had to flee
for his life? Did they inform you that the unbroken
goblet exists to this day, and is in fact now for sale by
an Hebrew Jew who peddles antiquities? Did they
tell you that?”</p>

<p>“Neither Edgar Allan Poe nor William Shakespeare
ever disturbs my slumbers by telling me anything of
the sort,” laughed Manning.</p>

<p>“Well, my <i lang="it">abbate</i> told me just that, and he gave me
the address of the Shylock who has the surviving goblet
for sale.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we go there and see it,” suggested Manning,
“and you can tell me the whole story of the twin
brothers as we go along.”</p>

<p>“Shall we take a gondola or walk?” was Larry’s
interrogative acceptance of the suggestion.</p>

<p>“It’s in the Ghetto, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Most of the Jew curiosity dealers have left the
Ghetto. Our Shylock has a palace on the Grand Canal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
I guess we had better take a gondola, though it can’t
be far.”</p>

<p>So they sat themselves down in one of the aquatic
cabs which ply the water streets of the city in the sea.
The gondolier stood to his oar and put his best foot
foremost, and as the boat sped forward on its way along
the great S of the Grand Canal, Larry told the tale of
the twin brothers and the shattered goblet.</p>

<p>“Well, it seems that some time in the sixteenth century,
say three hundred years ago or thereabout, there
were several branches of the great and powerful Manin
family&mdash;the same family to which the patriotic Daniele
Manin belonged, you know. And at the head of one
of these branches were the twin brothers Marco Manin
and Giovanni Manin. Now, these brothers were devoted
to each other, and they had only one thought,
one word, one deed. When one of them happened to
think of a thing, it often happened that the other
brother did it. So it was not surprising that they both
fell in love with the same woman. She was a dangerous-looking,
yellow-haired woman, with steel-gray eyes&mdash;that
is, if her eyes were not really green, as to which
there was doubt. But there was no doubt at all that
she was powerfully handsome. The <i lang="it">abbate</i> said that
there was a famous portrait of her in one of these
churches as a Saint Mary Magdalen, with her hair
down. She was a splendid creature, and lots of men
were running after her besides the twin Manins. The
two brothers did not quarrel with each other about the
woman, but they did quarrel with some of her other
lovers, and particularly with a nobleman of the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
rank and power, who was supposed to belong not only
to the Council of Ten, but to the Three. Between this
man and the Manins there was war to the knife and
the knife to the hilt. One day Marco Manin expressed
a wish for one of these goblets of Venetian glass so fine
that poison shatters it, and so Giovanni went out to
Murano and ordered two of them, of the very finest
quality, and just alike in every particular of color and
shape and size. You see the twins always had everything
in pairs. But the people at Murano somehow
misunderstood the order, and although they made both
glasses they sent home only one. Marco Manin was at
table when it arrived, and he took it in his hand at
once, and after admiring its exquisite workmanship&mdash;you
see, all these old Venetians had the art-feeling
strongly developed&mdash;he told a servant to fill it to the
brim with Cyprus wine. But as he raised the flowing
cup to his lips it shivered in his grasp and the wine was
spilt on the marble floor. He drew his sword and slew
the servant who had sought to betray him, and rushing
into the street he found himself face to face with the
enemy whom he knew to have instigated the attempt.
They crossed swords at once, but, before Marco Manin
could have a fair fight for his life, he was stabbed in the
back by a glass stiletto, the hilt of which was broken
off short in the wound.”</p>

<p>“Where was his brother all this time?” was the
first question with which John Manning broke the
thread of his friend’s story.</p>

<p>“He had been to see the yellow-haired beauty, and
he came back just in time to meet his brother’s lifeless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
body as it was carried into their desolate home. Holding
his dead brother’s hand, as he had often held it living,
he promised his brother to avenge his death without
delay and at any cost. Then he prepared at once for
flight. He knew that Venice would be too hot to hold
him when the deed was done; and besides, he felt
that without his brother life in Venice would be intolerable
So he made ready for flight. Twenty-four
hours to a minute after Marco Manin’s death the body
of the hireling assassin was sinking to the bottom of
the Grand Canal, while the man who had paid for the
murder lay dead on the same spot with the point of a
glass stiletto in his heart! And when they wanted to
send him the other goblet, there was no one to send it
to: Giovanni Manin had disappeared.”</p>

<p>“Where had he gone?” queried John Manning.</p>

<p>“That’s what I asked the <i lang="it">abbate</i>, and he said he
didn’t know for sure, but that in those days Venice had
a sizable trade with the Low Countries, and there was
a tradition that Giovanni Manin had gone to the
Netherlands.”</p>

<p>“To Holland?” asked John Manning with unwonted
interest.</p>

<p>“Yes, to Amsterdam, or to Rotterdam, or to some
one of those-dam towns, as we used to call them in our
geography class.”</p>

<p>“It was to Amsterdam,” said Manning, speaking as
one who had certain information.</p>

<p>“How do you know that?” asked Larry. “Even
the <i lang="it">abbate</i> said it was only a tradition that he had gone
to Holland at all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“He went to Amsterdam,” said Manning; “that I
know.”</p>

<p>Before Larry could ask how it was that his friend
knew anything about the place of exile of a man whom
he had never heard of ten minutes earlier, the gondola
had paused before the door of the palace in which dwelt
the dealer in antiquities who had in his possession the
famous goblet of Venetian glass. As they ascended to
the sequence of rambling rooms cluttered with old
furniture, rusty armor, and odds and ends of statuary,
in which the modern Jew of Venice sat at the receipt
of custom, both Larry Laughton and John Manning
had to give their undivided attention to the framing
in Italian of their wishes. Shylock himself was a
venerable and benevolent person, with a look of wonderful
shrewdness and an incomprehensibility of speech,
for he spoke the Venetian dialect with a harsh Jewish
accent, either of which would have daunted a linguistic
veteran. Plainly enough, conversation was impossible,
for he could barely understand their American-Italian,
and they could not at all understand his Jewish-Venetian.
But it would not do to let these <i lang="it">Inglesi</i> go away
without paying tribute.</p>

<p>“<i lang="it">Ciò!</i>” said Shylock, smiling graciously at his
futile attempts to open communication with the
enemy. Then he called Jessica from the deep window
where she had been at work on the quaint old
account-books of the shop, as great curiosities as anything
in it, since they were kept in Venetian, but by
means of the Hebrew alphabet. She spoke Italian,
and to her the young men made known their wants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
She said a few words to her father, and he brought
forth the goblet.</p>

<p>It was a marvellous specimen of the most exquisite
Venetian workmanship. A pair of green serpents,
with eyes that glowed like fire, writhed around the
golden stem of a blood-red bowl, and as the white
light of the cloudless sky fell on it from the broad
window, it burned in the glory of the sunshine and
seemed to fill itself full of some mysterious and royal
wine. Shylock revolved it slowly in his hand to show
the strange waviness of its texture, and as it turned,
the serpents clung more closely to the stem and arched
their heads and shot a glance of hate at the strangers
who came to gaze on them with curious fascination.</p>

<p>John Manning looked at the goblet long and eagerly.
“How did it come into your possession?” he asked.</p>

<p>And Jessica translated Shylock’s declaration that
the goblet had been at Murano for hundreds of years;
it was <i lang="it">anticho</i>&mdash;<i lang="it">antichissimo</i>, as the signor could see
for himself. It was of the best period of the art.
That Shylock would guarantee. How came it into his
possession? By the greatest good fortune. It was
taken from Murano during the troubles after the fall
of the Republic in the time of Napoleon. It had
gone finally into the hands of a certain count, who,
very luckily, was poor. <i lang="it">Conte che non conta, non
conta niente.</i> So Shylock had been enabled to buy it.
It had been the desire of his heart for years to own so
fine an object.</p>

<p>“How much do you want for it?” asked John
Manning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Shylock scented from afar the battle of bargaining,
dear in Italy to both buyer and seller. He gave a keen
look at both the <i lang="it">Inglesi</i>, and took up the glass affectionately,
as though he could not bear to part with it.
Jessica interpreted. Shylock had intended that goblet
for his own private collection, but the frank and generous
manner of their excellencies had overcome him,
and he would let them have it for five hundred florins.</p>

<p>“Five hundred florins! Phew!” whistled Larry,
astonished in spite of his initiation into the mysteries
of Italian bargaining. “Well, if you were to ask me
the Shakespearian conundrum, Hath not a Jew eyes?
I shouldn’t give it up; I should say he has eyes&mdash;for
the main chance.”</p>

<p>“Five hundred florins,” said John Manning. “Very
well. I’ll take it.”</p>

<p>Shylock’s astonishment at getting four times what
he would have taken was equalled only by his regret
that he had not asked twice as much.</p>

<p>“Can you pack it so that I can take it to New York
safely?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="it">Sicuro, signor</i>,” and Shylock agreed to have the
precious object boxed with all possible care and despatch,
and delivered at the hotel that afternoon.</p>

<p>“<i lang="it">Servo suo!</i>” said Jessica, as they stood at the door.</p>

<p>“<i lang="it">Bon di, Patron!</i>” responded Larry, in Venetian
fashion; then as the door closed behind them he said
to John Manning, “Seems to me you were in a hurry!
You could have had that glass for half the money.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I could,” was Manning’s quiet reply, “but
I was eager to get it back at once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>“Get it back? Why, it wasn’t stolen from <em>you</em>, was
it? I never did suppose <em>he</em> came by it honestly.”</p>

<p>“It was not stolen from me personally, but it belonged
to my family. It was made for Giovanni
Manin, who fled from Venice to Amsterdam three
hundred odd years ago. His grandson and namesake
left Amsterdam for New Amsterdam half a century
later. And when the English changed New Amsterdam
into New York, Jan Mannin became John Manning&mdash;and
I am his direct descendant, and the first of
my blood to return to Venice to get the goblet Giovanni
Manin ordered and left behind.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m damned!” said Larry, pensively.</p>

<p>“And now,” continued John Manning as they took
their seats in the gondola, “tell the man to go to the
church where the picture of Mary Magdalen is. I
want a good look at that woman!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the evening, as John Manning sat in a little <i lang="it">caffè</i>
under the arcades of the Piazza San Marco, sipping a
tiny cup of black coffee, Larry entered with a rush of
righteous indignation.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Larry?” was John Manning’s
calm query.</p>

<p>“There’s the devil to pay at home. South Carolina
has fired on the flag at Sumter.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Three weeks later Colonel Manning was assigned to
duty drilling the raw recruits soon to be the Army of
the Potomac.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<h3>II.<br />
<span class="smaller">IN THE NEW WORLD.</span></h3>

<p>In the month of February, 1864, a chance newspaper
paragraph informed whom it might concern that
Major Laurence Laughton, having three weeks’ leave
of absence from his regiment, was at the Astor House.
In consequence of this advertisement of his whereabouts,
Major Laughton received many cheerful circulars
and letters, in most of which his attention was
claimed for the artificial limb made by the advertiser.
He also received a letter from Colonel John Manning,
urgently bidding him to come out for a day at least to
his little place on the Hudson, where he was lying sick,
and, as he feared, sick unto death. On the receipt of
this Larry cut short a promising flirtation with a war-widow
who sat next him at table, and took the first
train up the river. It was a bleak day, and there was
at least a foot of snow on the ground, as hard and as
dry as though it had clean forgot that it was made of
water. As Larry left the little station, to which the
train had slowly struggled at last, an hour behind time,
the wind sprang up again and began to moan around
his feet and to sting his face with icy shot; and as he
trudged across the desolate path which led to Manning’s
lonely house he discovered that rude Boreas could be
as keen a sharp-shooter as any in the rifle-pits around
Richmond. A hard walk up-hill for a quarter of an
hour brought him to the brow of the cliff on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
stood the forlorn and wind-swept house where John
Manning lay. An unkempt and hideous old crone as
black as night opened the door for him. He left in the
hall his hat and overcoat and a little square box he
had brought in his hand; and then he followed the
ebony hag upstairs to Colonel Manning’s room. Here
at the door she left him, after giving a sharp knock.
A weak voice said, “Come in!”</p>

<p>Laurence Laughton entered the room with a quick
step, but the light-hearted words with which he had
meant to encourage his friend died on his lips as soon
as he saw how grievously that friend had changed.
John Manning had faded to a shadow of his former
self; the light of his eye was quenched, and the spirit
within him seemed broken; the fine, sensitive, noble
face lay white against the pillow, looking weary and
wan and hopeless. The effort to greet his friend exhausted
him and brought on a hard cough, and he
pressed his hand to his breast as though some hidden
malady were gnawing and burning within.</p>

<p>“Well, John,” said Larry, as he took a seat by the
bedside, “why didn’t you let me know before now that
you were laid up? I could have got away a month
ago.”</p>

<p>“Time enough yet,” said John Manning slowly;
“time enough yet. I shall not die for another week, I
fear.”</p>

<p>“Why, man, you must not talk like that. You are
as good as a dozen dead men yet,” said Larry, trying
to look as cheerful as might be.</p>

<p>“I am as good as dead myself,” said his friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
seriously, as befitted a man under the shadow of death;
“and I have no wish to live. The sooner I am out of
this pain and powerlessness the better I shall like it.”</p>

<p>“I say, John, old man, this is no way for you to
talk! Brace up, and you will soon be another man!”</p>

<p>“I shall soon be in another world, I hope,” and the
helpless misery of the tone in which these few words
were said smote Laurence Laughton to the heart.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?” he asked with as
lively an air as he could attain, for the ominous and
inexplicable sadness of the situation was fast taking
hold on him.</p>

<p>“I have a bullet through the lungs and a pain in the
heart.”</p>

<p>“But men do not die of a bullet in the lungs and a
pain in the heart,” was Larry’s encouraging response.</p>

<p>“I shall.”</p>

<p>“Why should you more than others?”</p>

<p>“Because there is something else&mdash;something mysterious,
some unknown malady&mdash;which bears me
down and burns me up. There is no use trying to
deceive me, Larry. My papers are made out, and I
shall get my discharge from the Army of the Living in
a very few days now. But I must not waste the little
breath I have left in talking about myself. I sent for
you to ask a favor.”</p>

<p>Larry held out his hand, and John Manning took it,
and seemed to gain strength from the firm clasp.</p>

<p>“I knew I could rely on you,” he said, “for much or
for little. And this is not much, for I have not much
to leave. This worn old house, which belonged to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
grandmother, and in which I spent the happiest hours
of my boyhood, this and a few shares of stock here
and there are all I have to leave. I do not know
what the house is worth, and I shall be glad when I
am gone from it. If I had not come here, I think
I might perhaps have got well. There seems to be
something deadly about the place.” The sick man’s
voice sank to a wavering whisper, as if it were borne
down by a sudden weight of impending danger against
which he might struggle in vain; he gave a fearful
glance about the room, as though seeking a mystic foe,
hidden and unknown. “The very first day we were
here the cat lapped its milk by the fire and then
stretched itself out and died without a sign. And I
had not been here two days before I felt the fatal influence:
the trouble from my wound came on again,
and this awful burning in my breast began to torture
me. As a boy, I thought that heaven must be like
this house; and now I should not want to die if I
thought hell could be worse!”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you leave the hole, since you hate it
so?” asked Larry, with what scant cheeriness he could
muster; he was yielding himself slowly to the place,
though he fought bravely against his superstitious
weakness.</p>

<p>“Am I fit to be moved?” was Manning’s query in
reply.</p>

<p>“But you will be better soon, and then”&mdash;</p>

<p>“I shall be worse before I am better, and I shall
never be better in this life or in this place. No, no, I
must die in my hole, like a dog. Like a dog!” and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
John Manning repeated the words with a wistful face,
“Do you remember the faithful beast who always
welcomed me here when we came up before we went
to Europe?”</p>

<p>“Of course I do,” said Larry, glad to get the sick
man away from his sickness, and to ease his mind by
talk on a healthy topic; “he was a splendid fellow, too.
Cæsar, that was his name, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Cæsar Borgia I called him,” was Manning’s sad
reply. “I knew you could not have forgotten him.
He is dead. Cæsar Borgia is dead. He was the last
living thing that loved me&mdash;except you, Larry, I know&mdash;and
he is dead. He died this morning. He came
to my bedside as usual, and he licked my hand gently
and looked up in my face, and laid him down alongside
of me on the carpet here and died. Poor Cæsar
Borgia&mdash;he loved me, and he is dead! And you,
Larry, you must not stay here. The air is fatal.
Every breath may be your last. When you have heard
what I want, you must be off at once. If you like, you
may come up again to the funeral before your leave is
up. I saw you had three weeks.”</p>

<p>Laurence Laughton moved uneasily in his chair and
swallowed with difficulty. “John,” he managed to
say after an effort, “if you talk to me like that, I shall
go at once. Tell me what it is you want me to do for
you.”</p>

<p>“I want you to take care of my wife and of my
child, if there be one born to me after my death.”</p>

<p>“Your wife?” repeated Larry, in staring surprise.</p>

<p>“You did not know I was married? I knew it at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the time, as the boy said,” and John Manning smiled
bitterly.</p>

<p>“Where is she?” was Larry’s second query.</p>

<p>“Here.”</p>

<p>“Here?”</p>

<p>“In this house. You shall see her before you go.
And after the funeral I want you to get her away from
here with what speed you can. Sell this house for
what it will bring, and put the money into government
bonds. You may find it hard to persuade her to
move, for she seems to have a strange liking for this
place. She breathes freely in the deadly air that suffocates
me. But you must not let her remain here;
this is no place for her now that a new life and new
duties are before her.”</p>

<p>“How was it I did not know of your marriage?”
asked Larry.</p>

<p>“I knew nothing about it myself twenty-four hours
before it happened,” answered John Manning. “You
need not look surprised. It is a simple story. I had
this shot through the breast at Gettysburg last Fourth
of July. I lay on the hillside a day and a night before
relief came. Then a farmer took me into his house.
A military surgeon dressed my wounds, but I owed
my life to the nursing and care and unceasing attention
of a young lady who was staying with the farmer’s
daughter. She had been doing her duty as a nurse
as near to the field as she could go ever since the first
Bull Run. She saved my life, and I gave it to her&mdash;what
there was of it. She was a beautiful woman,
indeed I never saw a more beautiful&mdash;and she has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
strange likeness to&mdash;but that you shall see for yourself
when you see her. She is getting a little rest now,
for she has been up all night attending to me. She
<em>will</em> wait on me in spite of all I say; of course I know
there is no use wasting effort on me now. She is the
most devoted nurse in the world; and we shall part as
we met&mdash;she taking care of me at the last as she did
at the first. Would God our relation had never been
other than patient and nurse! It would have been
better for both had we never been husband and wife!”
And John Manning turned his face to the wall with a
weary sigh; then he coughed harshly, and raised his
hand to his breast as though to stifle the burning
within him.</p>

<p>“It seems to me, John, that you ought not to talk
like that of the woman you loved,” said Laurence
Laughton, with unusual seriousness.</p>

<p>“I never loved her,” answered Manning, coldly.
Then he turned, and asked hastily, “Do you think I
should want to die if I loved her?”</p>

<p>“But she loves you,” said Laurence.</p>

<p>“She never loved me!” was Manning’s impatient
retort.</p>

<p>“Then why were you married?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I would like to know. It was fate, I
suppose. What is to be, is. I never used to believe
in predestination, but I know that of my own free will
I could never have done what I did.”</p>

<p>“I confess I do not understand you,” said Larry.</p>

<p>“I do not understand myself. There is so much in
this world that is mysterious&mdash;I hope the next will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
different. I was under the charm, I fancy, when I
married her. She is a beautiful woman, as I told you,
and I was a man, and I was weak, and I had hope.
Why she married me that early September evening I
do not know. It was not long before we both found
out our mistake. And it was too late then. We were
man and wife. Don’t suppose I blame her&mdash;I do not.
I have no cause of complaint. She is a good wife to
me, as I have tried to be a good husband to her. We
made a mistake in marrying each other, and we know
it&mdash;that’s all!”</p>

<p>Before Laurence Laughton could answer, the door
opened gently and Mrs. Manning entered the room.
Laurence rose to greet his friend’s wife, but the act was
none the less a homage to her resplendent beauty. In
spite of the worn look of her face, she was the most
beautiful woman he had ever seen. She had tawny,
tigress hair, and hungry, tigress eyes. The eyes,
indeed, were fathomless and indescribable, and their
fitful glance had something uncanny about it. The
hair was nearly of the true Venetian color, and she
had the true Venetian sumptuousness of appearance,
simple as was her attire. She seemed as though she
had just risen from the couch whereon she reclined
before Titian or Tintoretto, and, having clothed herself,
had walked forth in this nineteenth century and
these United States. She was a strange and striking
figure, and Laurence found it impossible to analyze
exactly the curious and weird impression she produced
on him. Her voice, as she greeted him, gave him a
peculiar thrill; and when he shook hands with her he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
seemed to feel himself face to face with some strange
being from another land and another century. She
inspired him with a supernatural awe he was not wont
to feel in the presence of woman. He had a dim consciousness
that there lingered in his memory the glimmering
image of some woman seen somewhere, he
knew not when, who was like unto the woman before
him.</p>

<p>As she took her seat by the side of the bed she gave
Laurence Laughton a look that seemed to peer into his
soul. Laurence felt himself quiver under it. It was
a look to make a man fearful. Then John Manning,
who had moved uneasily as his wife entered, said,
“Laurence, can you see any resemblance in my wife
to any one you ever saw before?”</p>

<p>Their eyes met again, and again Laurence had a
vague remembrance as though he and she had stood
face to face before in some earlier existence. Then his
wandering recollections took shape, and he remembered
the face and the form and the haunting mystery of the
expression, and he felt for a moment as though he had
been permitted to peer into the cabalistic darkness of
an awful mystery, though he failed wholly to perceive
its occult significance&mdash;if significance there were of
any sort.</p>

<p>“I think I do remember,” he said at last. “It was
in Venice&mdash;at the Church of Santa Maria Magdalena&mdash;the
picture there that”&mdash;</p>

<p>“You remember aright!” interrupted John Manning.
“My wife is the living image of the Venetian
woman for whose beauty Marco Manin was one day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
stabbed in the back with a glass stiletto, and Giovanni
Manin fled from the place of his birth and never saw it
again. It is idle to fight against the stars in their
courses. We met here in the New World, she and I,
as they met in the Old World so long ago&mdash;and the
end is the same. It was to be&mdash;it was to be!”</p>

<p>Laurence Laughton gave a swift glance at his friend’s
wife to see what effect these words might have on her,
and he was startled to detect on her face the same
enigmatic smile which was the chief memory he had
retained of the Venetian picture. Truly the likeness
between the painting and the wife of his friend was
marvellous; and Laurence tried to shake off a morbid
wonder whether there might be any obscure and inscrutable
survival from one generation to another across
the seas and across the years.</p>

<p>“If you remember the picture,” said John Manning,
“perhaps you remember the quaint goblet of Venetian
glass I bought the same day?”</p>

<p>“Of course I do,” said Larry, glad to get Manning
started on a topic of talk a little less personal.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you know what has become of it?” asked
Manning.</p>

<p>“I can answer ‘of course’ to that, too,” replied
Larry, “because I have it here.”</p>

<p>“Here?”</p>

<p>“Here&mdash;in a little square box, in the hall,” answered
Larry. “I had it in my trunk, you know, when we
took passage on the <i>Vanderbilt</i> at Havre that May
morning. I forgot to give it to you in the hurry of
landing, and I haven’t had a chance since. This is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
first time I have seen you for nearly three years. I
found the box this morning, and I thought you might
like to have it again, so I brought it up.”</p>

<p>John Manning rang the bell at the head of his bed.
The black crone answered it, and soon returned with
the little square box. Manning impatiently broke the
seals and cords that bound its cover and began eagerly
to release the goblet from the cotton and tissue paper
in which it had been carefully swathed and bandaged.
Mrs. Manning, though her moods were subtler and more
intense, showed an anxiety to see the goblet quite as
feverish as her husband’s. In a minute the last wrapping
was twisted off and the full beauty of the Venetian
glass was revealed to them. Assuredly no praise
was too loud for its delicate and exquisite workmanship.</p>

<p>“Does Mrs. Manning know the story of the goblet?”
asked Larry; “has she been told of the peculiar virtue
ascribed to it?”</p>

<p>“She has too great a fondness for the horrible and
the fantastic not to have heard the story in its smallest
details,” said Manning.</p>

<p>Mrs. Manning had taken the glass in her fine, thin
hands. Evidently it and its mystic legend had a
morbid fascination for her. A strange light gleamed
in her wondrous eyes, and Laughton was startled again
to see the extraordinary resemblance between her and
the picture they had looked at on the day the goblet had
been bought.</p>

<p>“When the poison was poured into it,” she said at
last, with quick and restless glances at the two men,
“the glass broke&mdash;then the tale was true?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“It was a coincidence only, I’m afraid,” said her
husband, who had rallied and regained strength under
the unwonted excitement.</p>

<p>Just then the old-fashioned clock on the stairs struck
five. Mrs. Manning started up, holding the goblet in
her hand.</p>

<p>“It is time for your medicine,” she said.</p>

<p>“As you please,” answered her husband wearily,
sinking back on his pillow. “My wife insists on giving
me every drop of my potions with her own hands. I
shall not trouble her much longer, and I doubt if it is
any use for her to trouble me now.”</p>

<p>“I shall give you everything in this glass after this,”
she said.</p>

<p>“In the Venetian glass?” asked Larry.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, turning on him fiercely; “why
not?”</p>

<p>“Do you think the doctor is trying to poison me?”
asked her husband.</p>

<p>“No, I do not think the doctor is trying to poison
you,” she repeated mechanically, as she moved toward
a little sideboard in a corner of the room. “But I shall
give you all your medicines in this hereafter.”</p>

<p>She stood at the little sideboard, with her back
toward them, and she mingled the contents of various
phials in the Venetian goblet. Then she turned to
cross the room to her husband. As she walked with
the glass in her hand there was a rift in the clouds high
over the other side of the river, and the rays of the
setting sun thrust themselves through the window and
lighted up the glory of her hair and showed the strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
gleam in her staring eyes. Another step, and the red
rays fell on the Venetian glass, and it burned and
glowed, and the green serpents twined about its ruby
stem seemed to twist and crawl with malignant life,
while their scorching eyes shot fire. Another step, and
she stood by the bedside. As John Manning reached
out his hand for the goblet, a tremor passed through
her, her fingers clinched the fragile stem, and the glass
fell on the floor and was shattered to shivers as its
fellow had been shattered three centuries ago and more.
She still stared steadily before her; then her lips parted,
and she said, “The glass broke&mdash;the glass broke&mdash;then
the tale is true!” And with one hysteric shriek
she fell forward amid the fragments of the Venetian
goblet, unconscious thereafter of all things.</p>

<h2 id="THE_RED_SILK_HANDKERCHIEF">THE RED SILK HANDKERCHIEF.</h2>

<p class="author">BY H. C. BUNNER.</p>

<p>The yellow afternoon sun came in through the long
blank windows of the room wherein the Superior
Court of the State of New York, Part II., Gillespie,
Judge, was in session. The hour of adjournment was
near at hand, a dozen court-loungers slouched on the
hard benches in the attitudes of cramped carelessness
which mark the familiar of the halls of justice. Beyond
the rail sat a dozen lawyers and lawyers’ clerks,
and a dozen weary jurymen. Above the drowsy
silence rose the nasal voice of the junior counsel for
the defence, who in a high monotone, with his faint
eyes fixed on the paper in his hand, was making something
like a half-a-score of “requests to charge.”</p>

<p>Nobody paid attention to him. Two lawyers’ clerks
whispered like mischievous schoolboys, hiding behind
a pile of books that towered upon a table. Junior
counsel for the plaintiff chewed his pencil and took
advantage of his opportunity to familiarize himself
with certain neglected passages of the New Code.
The crier, like a half-dormant old spider, sat in his
place and watched a boy who was fidget ting at the far
end of the room, and who looked as though he wanted
to whistle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>The jurymen might have been dream-men, vague
creations of an autumn afternoon’s doze. It was hard
to connect them with a world of life and business.
Yet, gazing closer, you might have seen that one
looked as if he were thinking of his dinner, and another
as if he were thinking of the lost love of his youth; and
that the expression on the faces of the others ranged
from the vacant to the inscrutable. The oldest juror,
at the end of the second row, was sound asleep.
Everyone in the court-room, except himself, knew it.
No one cared.</p>

<p>Gillespie, J., was writing his acceptance of an invitation
to a dinner set for that evening at Delmonico’s.
He was doing this in such a way that he appeared to
be taking copious and conscientious notes. Long years
on the bench had whitened Judge Gillespie’s hair, and
taught him how to do this. His seeming attentiveness
much encouraged the counsel for the defence, whose
high-pitched tone rasped the air like the buzzing of a bee
that has found its way through the slats of the blind
into some darkened room, of a summer noon, and that,
as it seeks angrily for egress, raises its shrill scandalized
protest against the idleness and the pleasant gloom.</p>

<p>“We r’quest y’r Honor t’ charge: First, ’t forcible
entry does not const’oot tresp’ss, ’nless intent’s
proved. Thus, ’f a man rolls down a bank”&mdash;</p>

<p>But the judge’s thoughts were in the private supper-room
at Delmonico’s. He had no interest in the sad
fate of the hero of the suppositious case, who had been
obliged, by a strange and ingenious combination of
accidents, to make violent entrance, incidentally damaging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the persons and property of others, into the lands
and tenements of his neighbor.</p>

<p>And further away yet the droning lawyer had set
a-travelling the thoughts of Horace Walpole, clerk for
Messrs. Weeden, Snowden &amp; Gilfeather; for the
young man sat with his elbows on the table, his head
in his hands, a sad half-smile on his lips, and his brown
eyes looking through vacancy to St. Lawrence County,
New York.</p>

<p>He saw a great, shabby old house, shabby with the
awful shabbiness of a sham grandeur laid bare by time
and mocked of the pitiless weather. There was a great
sham Grecian portico at one end; the white paint was
well-nigh washed away, and the rain-streaked wooden
pillars seemed to be weeping tears of penitence for
having lied about themselves and pretended to be
marble.</p>

<p>The battened walls were cracked and blistered.
The Grecian temple on the hillock near looked much
like a tomb, and not at all like a summer-house. The
flower-garden was so rank and ragged, so overgrown
with weed and vine, that it was spared the mortification
of revealing its neglected maze, the wonder of the
county in 1820. All was sham, save the decay. That
was real; and by virtue of its decrepitude the old
house seemed to protest against modern contempt, as
though it said: “I have had my day. I was built
when people thought this sort of thing was the right
sort of thing; when we had our own little pseudo-classic
renaissance in America. I lie between the
towns of Aristotle and Sabine Farms. I am a gentleman’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
residence, and my name is Montevista. I was
built by a prominent citizen. You need not laugh
through your lattices, you smug new Queen Anne cottage,
down there in the valley! What will become of
you when the falsehood is found out of your imitation
bricks and your tiled roof of shingles, and your stained
glass that is only a sheet of transparent paper pasted
on a pane? You are a young sham; I am an old one.
Have some respect for age!”</p>

<p>Its age was the crowning glory of the estate of
Montevista. There was nothing new on the place
except a third mortgage. Yet had Montevista villa
put forth a juster claim to respect, it would have said:
“I have had my day. Where all is desolate and silent
now, there was once light and life. Along these halls
and corridors, the arteries of my being, pulsed a hot
blood of joyous humanity, fed with delicate fare, kindled
with generous wine. Every corner under my roof
was alive with love and hope and ambition. Great
men and dear women were here; and the host was
great and the hostess was gracious among them all.
The laughter of children thrilled my gaudily decked
stucco. To-day an old man walks up and down my
lonely drawing-rooms, with bent head, murmuring to
himself odds and ends of tawdry old eloquence, wandering
in a dead land of memory, waiting till Death
shall take him by the hand and lead him out of his
ruinous house, out of his ruinous life.”</p>

<p>Death had indeed come between Horace and the
creation of his spiritual vision. Never again should
the old man walk, as to the boy’s eyes he walked now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
over the creaking floors, from where the Nine Muses
simpered on the walls of the south parlor to where
Homer and Plutarch, equally simpering, yet simpering
with a difference,&mdash;severely simpering,&mdash;faced each
other across the north room. Horace saw his father
stalking on his accustomed round, a sad, familiar figure,
tall and bent. The hands were clasped behind the
back, the chin was bowed on the black stock; but every
now and then the thin form drew itself straight, the
fine, clean-shaven, aquiline face was raised, beaming
with the ghost of an old enthusiasm, and the long right
arm was lifted high in the air as he began, his sonorous
tones a little tremulous in spite of the restraint of old-time
pomposity and deliberation,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Mr. Speaker, I rise;”&mdash;or, “If your Honor
please”&mdash;</p>

<p>The forlorn, helpless earnestness of this mockery of
life touched Horace’s heart; and yet he smiled to think
how different were the methods and manners of his
father from those of brother Hooper, whose requests
still droned up to the reverberating hollows of the roof,
and there were lost in a subdued boom and snarl of
echoes such as a court-room only can beget.</p>

<p>Two generations ago, when the Honorable Horace
Kortlandt Walpole was the rising young lawyer of the
State; when he was known as “the Golden-Mouthed
Orator of St. Lawrence County,” he was in the habit
of assuming that he owned whatever court he practised
in; and, as a rule, he was right. The most bullock-brained
of country judges deferred to the brilliant
young master of law and eloquence, and his “requests”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
were generally accepted as commands and obeyed as
such. Of course the great lawyer, for form’s sake, threw
a veil of humility over his deliverances; but even that
he rent to shreds when the fire of his eloquence once
got fairly aglow.</p>

<p>“May it please your Honor! Before your Honor
exercises the sacred prerogative of your office&mdash;before
your Honor performs the sacred duty which the State
has given into your hands&mdash;before, with that lucid
genius to which I bow my head, you direct the minds
of these twelve good men and true in the path of strict
judicial investigation, I ask your Honor to instruct them
that they must bring to their deliberations that impartial
justice which the laws of our beloved country&mdash;of
which no abler exponent than your Honor has
ever graced the bench,&mdash;which the laws of our beloved
country guarantee to the lowest as well as to the
loftiest of her citizens&mdash;from the President in the
Executive Mansion to the humble artisan at the forge&mdash;throughout
this broad land, from the lagoons of
Louisiana to where the snow-clad forests of Maine hurl
defiance at the descendants of Tory refugees in the
barren wastes of Nova Scotia”&mdash;</p>

<p>Horace remembered every word and every gesture
of that speech. He recalled even the quick upward
glance from under the shaggy eyebrows with which
his father seemed to see again the smirking judge
catching at the gross bait of flattery; he knew the
little pause which the speaker’s memory had filled with
the applause of an audience long since dispersed to
various silent country graveyards; and he wondered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
pityingly, if it were possible that even in his father’s
prime that wretched allusion to old political hatreds
had power to stir the fire of patriotism in the citizen’s
bosom.</p>

<p>“Poor old father!” said the boy to himself. The
voice which had for so many years been but an echo
was stilled wholly now. Brief victory and long defeat
were nothing now to the golden-mouthed orator.</p>

<p>“Shall I fail as he failed?” thought Horace: “No!
I can’t. Haven’t I got <em>her</em> to work for?”</p>

<p>And then he drew out of his breast pocket a red
silk handkerchief and turned it over in his hand with
a movement that concealed and caressed at the same
time.</p>

<p>It was a very red handkerchief. It was not vermilion,
nor “cardinal,” nor carmine,&mdash;a strange Oriental
idealization of blood-red which lay well on the
soft, fine, luxurious fabric. But it was an unmistakable,
a shameless, a barbaric red.</p>

<p>And as he looked at it, young Hitchcock, of Hitchcock
&amp; Van Rensselaer, came up behind him and
leaned over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Where did you get the handkerchief, Walpole?”
he whispered; “you ought to hang that out for an
auction flag, and sell out your cases.”</p>

<p>Horace stuffed it back in his pocket.</p>

<p>“You’d be glad enough to buy some of them, if you
got the show,” he returned; but the opportunity for a
prolonged contest of wit was cut short. The judge
was folding his letter, and the nasal counsel, having
finished his reading, stood gazing in doubt and trepidation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
at the bench, and asking himself why his Honor
had not passed on each point as presented. He found
out.</p>

<p>“Are you prepared to submit those requests in
writing?” demanded Gillespie, J., sharply and suddenly.
He knew well enough that that poor little
nasal, nervous junior counsel would never have trusted
himself to speak ten consecutive sentences in court
without having every word on paper before him.</p>

<p>“Ye-yes,” the counsel stammered, and handed up
his careful manuscript.</p>

<p>“I will examine these to-night,” said his Honor, and,
apparently, he made an endorsement on the papers.
He was really writing the address on the envelope of
his letter. Then there was a stir, and a conversation
between the judge and two or three lawyers, all at
once, which was stopped when his Honor gave an
Olympian nod to the clerk.</p>

<p>The crier arose.</p>

<p>“He’ ye! he’ ye! he’ ye!” he shouted with perfunctory
vigor. “Wah&mdash;wah&mdash;wah!” the high ceiling
slapped back at him; and he declaimed, on one note,
a brief address to “Awperns han bins” in that court,
of which nothing was comprehensible save the words
“Monday next at eleven o’clock.” And then the
court collectively rose, and individually put on hats for
the most part of the sort called queer.</p>

<p>All the people were chattering in low voices; chairs
were moved noisily, and the slumbering juror opened
his weary eyes and troubled himself with an uncalled-for
effort to look as though he had been awake all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
time and didn’t like the way things were going, at all.
Horace got from the clerk the papers for which he had
been waiting, and was passing out, when his Honor
saw him and hailed him with an expressive grunt.</p>

<p>Gillespie, J., looked over his spectacles at Horace.</p>

<p>“Shall you see Judge Weeden at the office? Yes?
Will you have the kindness to give him this&mdash;yes?
If it’s no trouble to you, of course.”</p>

<p>Gillespie, J., was not over-careful of the feelings of
lawyers’ clerks, as a rule; but he had that decent disinclination
to act <i lang="la">ultra præscriptum</i> which marks the
attitude of the well-bred man toward his inferiors in
office. He knew that he had no business to use Weeden,
Snowden &amp; Gilfeather’s clerk as a messenger in
his private correspondence.</p>

<p>Horace understood him, took the letter, and allowed
himself a quiet smile when he reached the crowded
corridor.</p>

<p>What mattered, he thought, as his brisk feet clattered
down the wide stairs of the rotunda, the petty insolence
of office <em>now</em>? He was Gillespie’s messenger
to-day; but had not his young powers already received
recognition from a greater than Gillespie? If Judge
Gillespie lived long enough he should put his gouty old
legs under Judge Walpole’s mahogany, and prose over
his port&mdash;yes, he should have port, like the relic of
mellow old days that he was&mdash;of the times “when
your father-in-law and I, Walpole, were boys together.”</p>

<p>Ah, there you have the spell of the Red Silk Handkerchief!</p>

<p>It was a wonderful tale to Horace; for he saw it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
that wonderful light which shall shine on no man of
us more than once in his life&mdash;on some of us not at
all, Heaven help us!&mdash;but, in the telling, it is a simple
tale:</p>

<p>“The Golden-Mouthed Orator of St. Lawrence” was
at the height of his fame in that period of storm and
stress which had the civil war for its climax. His misfortune
was to be drawn into a contest for which he
was not equipped, and in which he had little interest.
His sphere of action was far from the battle-ground of
the day. The intense localism that bounded his knowledge
and his sympathies had but one break&mdash;he had
tasted in his youth the extravagant hospitality of the
South, and he held it in grateful remembrance. So it
happened that he was a trimmer,&mdash;a moderationist he
called himself,&mdash;a man who dealt in optimistic generalities,
and who thought that if everybody&mdash;the slaves
included&mdash;would only act temperately and reasonably,
and view the matter from the standpoint of pure policy,
the differences of South and North could be settled as
easily as, through his own wise intervention, the old
turnip-field feud of Farmer Oliver and Farmer Bunker
had been wiped out of existence.</p>

<p>His admirers agreed with him, and they sent him to
Congress to fill the unexpired short term of their representative,
who had just died in Washington of what
we now know as a malarial fever. It was not to be
expected, perhaps, that the Honorable Mr. Walpole
would succeed in putting a new face on the great
political question in the course of his first term; but
they all felt sure that his first speech would startle men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
who had never heard better than what Daniel Webster
had had to offer them.</p>

<p>But the gods were against the Honorable Mr. Walpole.
On the day set for his great effort there was
what the theatrical people call a counter-attraction.
Majah Pike had come up from Mizourah, sah, to cane
that demn’d Yankee hound, Chahles Sumnah, sah,&mdash;yes,
sah, to thrash him like a dawg, begad! And all Washington
had turned out to see the performance, which
was set down for a certain hour, in front of Mr. Sumner’s
door.</p>

<p>There was just a quorum when the golden-mouthed
member began his great speech,&mdash;an inattentive, chattering
crowd, that paid no attention to his rolling rhetoric
and rococo grandiloquence. He told the empty
seats what a great country this was, and how beautiful
was a middle policy, and he illustrated this with a
quotation from Homer, in the original Greek (a neat
novelty: Latin was fashionable for parliamentary use
in Webster’s time), with, for the benefit of the uneducated,
the well-known translation by the great Alexander
Pope, commencing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“To calm their passions with the words of Age,</div>
<div class="verse">Slow from his seat arose the Pylian sage,</div>
<div class="verse">Experienced Nestor, in Persuasion skilled,</div>
<div class="verse">Words sweet as honey from his lips distilled”&mdash;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When Nestor and Mr. Walpole closed, there was no
quorum. The member from New Jersey, who had
engaged him in debate, was sleeping the sleep of
honorable intoxication in his seat. Outside, all Washington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
was laughing and cursing. Majah Pike had not
appeared.</p>

<p>It was the end of the golden-mouthed orator. His
voice was never heard again in the House. His one
speech was noticed only to be laughed at, and the news
went home to his constituents. They showed that
magnanimity which the poets tell us is an attribute of
the bucolic character. They, so to speak, turned over
the pieces of their broken idol with their cow-hide
boots, and remarked that they had known it was clay,
all along, and dern poor clay at that.</p>

<p>So the golden-mouthed went home, to try to make a
ruined practice repair his ruined fortune; to give mortgages
on his home to pay the debts his hospitality had
incurred; to discuss with a few feeble old friends ways
and means by which the war might have been averted;
to beget a son of his old age, and to see the boy grow
up in a new generation, with new ideas, new hopes,
new ambitions, and a lifetime before him to make
memories in.</p>

<p>They had little enough in common, but they came to
be great friends as the boy grew older, for Horace, inherited
all his traits from the old man, except a certain
stern energy which came from his silent, strong-hearted
mother, and which his father saw with a sad joy.</p>

<p>Mr. Walpole sent his son to New York to study law
in the office of Messrs. Weeden, Snowden &amp; Gilfeather,
who were a pushing young firm in 1850. Horace found
it a very quiet and conservative old concern. Snowden
and Gilfeather were dead; Weeden had been on the
bench and had gone off the bench at the call of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
“lucrative practice;” there were two new partners,
whose names appeared only on the glass of the office
door and in a corner of the letter-heads.</p>

<p>Horace read his law to some purpose. He became
the managing clerk of Messrs. Weeden, Snowden &amp;
Gilfeather. This particular managing clerkship was
one of unusual dignity and prospective profit. It
meant, as it always does, great responsibility, little
honor, and less pay. But the firm was so peculiarly
constituted that the place was a fine stepping-stone for
a bright and ambitious boy. One of the new partners
was a business man, who had put his money into the
concern in 1860, and who knew and cared nothing
about law. He kept the books and managed the
money, and was beyond that only a name on the door
and a terror to the office-boys. The other new partner
was a young man who made a specialty of collecting
debts. He could wring gold out of the stoniest and
barrenest debtor; and there his usefulness ended. The
general practice of the firm rested on the shoulders of
Judge Weeden, who was old, lazy, and luxury-loving,
and who, to tell the honest truth, shirked his duties.
Such a state of affairs would have wrecked a younger
house; but Weeden, Snowden &amp; Gilfeather had a great
name, and the consequences of his negligent feebleness
had not yet descended upon Judge Weeden’s head.</p>

<p>That they would, in a few years, that the Judge knew
it, and that he was quite ready to lean on a strong
young arm, Horace saw clearly.</p>

<p>That his own arm was growing in strength he also
saw; and the Judge knew that, too. He was Judge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Weeden’s pet. All in the office recognized the fact.
All, after reflection, concluded that it was a good thing
that he was. New blood had to come into the firm
sooner or later, and although it was not possible to
watch the successful rise of this boy without a little
natural envy and heart-burning, yet it was to be considered
that Horace was one who would be honorable,
just, and generous wherever fortune put him.</p>

<p>Horace was a gentleman. They all knew it. Barnes
and Haskins, the business man and the champion collector,
knew it down in the shallows of their vulgar
little souls. Judge Weeden, who had some of that
mysterious ichor of gentlehood in his wine-fed veins,
knew it and rejoiced in it. And Horace&mdash;I can say
for Horace that he never forgot it.</p>

<p>He was such a young prince of managing clerks that
no one was surprised when he was sent down to Sand
Hills, Long Island, to make preparations for the reorganization
of the Great Breeze Hotel Company, and
the transfer of the property known as the Breeze Hotel
and Park to its new owners. The Breeze Hotel was
a huge “Queen Anne” vagary which had, after the
fashion of hotels, bankrupted its first owners, and was
now going into the hands of new people, who were
likely to make their fortunes out of it. The property
had been in litigation for a year or so; the mechanics’
liens were numerous, and the mechanics clamorous;
and although the business was not particularly complicated,
it needed careful and patient adjustment.
Horace knew the case in every detail. He had
drudged over it all the winter, with no especial hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of personal advantage, but simply because that was his
way of working. He went down in June to the
mighty barracks, and lived for a week in what would
have been an atmosphere of paint and carpet-dye had
it not been for the broad sea wind that blew through
the five hundred open windows, and swept rooms and
corridors with salty freshness. The summering folk
had not arrived yet; there were only the new manager
and his six score of raw recruits of clerks and servants.
But Horace felt the warm blood coming back to his
cheeks, that the town had somewhat paled, and he was
quite content; and every day he went down to the
long, lonely beach, and had a solitary swim, although
the sharp water whipped his white skin to a biting red.
The sea takes a long while to warm up to the summer,
and is sullen about it.</p>

<p>He was to have returned to New York at the end of
the week, and Haskins was to have taken his place; but
it soon became evident to Weeden, Snowden &amp; Gilfeather
that the young man would attend to all that
was to be done at Sand Hills quite as well as Mr. Haskins,
or&mdash;quite as well as Judge Weeden himself, for
that matter. He had to shoulder no great responsibility;
the work was mostly of a purely clerical nature,
vexatious enough, but simple. It had to be done on
the spot, however; the original Breeze Hotel and Park
Company was composed of Sand Hillers, and the
builders were Sand Hillers, too, the better part of them.
And there were titles to be searched; for the whole
scheme was an ambitious splurge of Sand Hills pride
and it had been undertaken and carried out in a reckless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
and foolish way. Horace knew all the wretched
little details of the case, and so Horace was entrusted
with duties such as do not often devolve upon a man
of his years; and he took up his burden proudly, and
with a glowing consciousness of his own strength.</p>

<p>Judge Weeden missed his active and intelligent
obedience in the daily routine of office business; but
the Judge thought it was just as well that Horace
should not know that fact. The young man’s time
would come soon enough, and he would be none the
worse for serving his apprenticeship in modesty and
humility. The work entrusted to him was an honor
in itself. And then, there was no reason why poor
Walpole’s boy shouldn’t have a sort of half-holiday out
in the country, and enjoy his youth.</p>

<p>He was not recalled. The week stretched out. He
worked hard, found time to play, hugged his quickened
ambitions to his breast, wrote hopeful letters to the
mother at Montevista, made a luxury of his loneliness,
and felt a bashful resentment when the “guests”
of the hotel began to pour in from the outside
world.</p>

<p>For a day or two he fought shy of them. But these
first comers were lonely too, and not so much in love
with loneliness as he thought he was, and very soon he
became one of them. He had found out all the walks
and drives; he knew the times of the tides; he had
made friends with the fishermen for a league up and
down the coast, and he had amassed a store of valuable
hints as to where the first blue-fish might be expected
to run. Altogether he was a very desirable companion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Besides, that bright, fresh face of his, and a certain
look in it, made you friends with him at once, especially
if you happened to be a little older, and to remember
a look of the sort, lost, lost forever, in a boy’s looking-glass.</p>

<p>So he was sought out, and he let himself be found,
and the gregarious instinct in him waxed delightfully.</p>

<p>And then It came. Perhaps I should say She came;
but it is not the woman we love; it is our dream of
her. Sweet and tender, fair and good, she may be;
but let it be honor enough for her that she has that
glory about her face which our love kindles to the halo
that lights many a man’s life to the grave, though the
face beneath it be dead or false.</p>

<p>I will not admit that it was only a pretty girl from
Philadelphia who came to Sand Hills that first week in
July. It was the rosy goddess herself, dove-drawn
across the sea, in the warm path of the morning sun&mdash;although
the tremulous, old-fashioned handwriting on
the hotel register only showed that the early train had
brought&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“<i>Samuel Rittenhouse,     Philadelphia.<br />
Miss Rittenhouse,           do.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p>It was the Honorable Samuel Rittenhouse, ex-Chief-Justice
of Pennsylvania, the honored head of the
Pennsylvania bar, and the legal representative of the
Philadelphia contingent of the new Breeze Hotel and
Park Company.</p>

<p>In the evening Horace called upon him in his rooms
with a cumbersome stack of papers, and patiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
waded through explanations and repetitions until Mr.
Rittenhouse’s testy courtesy&mdash;he had the nervous
manner of age apprehensive of youthful irreverence&mdash;melted
into a complacent and fatherly geniality.
Then, when the long task was done and his young
guest arose, he picked up the card that lay on the
table and trained his glasses on it.</p>

<p>“‘H. K. Walpole?’” he said: “are you a New
Yorker, sir?”</p>

<p>“From the north of the State,” Horace told him.</p>

<p>“Indeed, indeed. Why, let me see&mdash;you must be
the son of my old friend Walpole&mdash;of Otsego&mdash;wasn’t
it?” said the old gentleman, still tentatively.</p>

<p>“St. Lawrence, sir.”</p>

<p>“Yes, St. Lawrence&mdash;of course, of course. Why,
I knew your father well, years ago, sir. We were at
college together.”</p>

<p>“At Columbia?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes. Why, bless me,” Judge Rittenhouse
went on, getting up to look at Horace: “you’re the
image of your poor father at your age. A very brilliant
man, sir, a very able man. I did not see much of him
after we left college&mdash;I was a Pennsylvanian, and he
was from this State&mdash;but I have always remembered
your father with respect and regard, sir,&mdash;a very
able man. I think I heard of his death some years
ago.”</p>

<p>“Three years ago,” said Horace. His voice fell somewhat.
How little to this old man of success was the
poor, unnoticed death of failure!</p>

<p>“Three years only!” repeated the judge, half apologetically;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
“ah, people slip away from each other in
this world&mdash;slip away. But I’m glad to have met you,
sir&mdash;very much pleased indeed. Rosamond!”</p>

<p>For an hour the subdued creaking of a rocking-chair
by the window had been playing a monotonously
pleasant melody in Horace’s ears. Now and then a
coy wisp of bright hair, or the reflected ghost of it, had
flashed into view in the extreme lower left-hand corner
of a mirror opposite him. Once he had seen a bit of
white brow under it, and from time to time the low
flutter of turning magazine leaves had put in a brief
second to the rocking-chair.</p>

<p>All this time Horace’s brains had been among the
papers on the table; but something else within him
had been swaying to and fro with the rocking-chair,
and giving a leap when the wisp of hair bobbed into
sight.</p>

<p>Now the rocking-chair accompaniment ceased, and
the curtained corner by the window yielded up its
treasure, and Miss Rittenhouse came forward, with one
hand brushing the wisp of hair back into place, as if
she were on easy and familiar terms with it. Horace
envied it.</p>

<p>“Rosamond,” said the judge: “This is Mr. Walpole,
the son of my old friend Walpole. You have heard
me speak of Mr. Walpole’s father.”</p>

<p>“Yes, papa,” said the young lady, all but the corners
of her mouth. And, oddly enough, Horace did not
think of being saddened because this young woman
had never heard of his father. Life was going on a
new key, all of a sudden, with a hint of a melody to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
be unfolded that ran in very different cadences from
the poor old tune of memory.</p>

<p>My heroine, over whose head some twenty summers
had passed, was now in the luxuriant prime of her
youthful beauty. Over a brow whiter than the driven
snow fell clustering ringlets, whose hue&mdash;</p>

<p>That is the way the good old novelists and story-tellers
of the Neville and Beverley days would have set
out to describe Miss Rittenhouse, had they known her.
Fools and blind! As if anyone could describe&mdash;as if
a poet, even, could more than hint at what a man sees
in a woman’s face when, seeing, he loves.</p>

<p>For a few moments the talkers were constrained, and
the talk was meagre and desultory. Then the Judge,
who had been rummaging around among the dust-heaps
of his memory, suddenly recalled the fact that he had
once, in stage-coach days, passed a night at Montevista,
and had been most hospitably treated. He dragged
this fact forth, professed a lively remembrance of Mrs.
Walpole,&mdash;“a fine woman, sir, your mother; a woman
of many charms,”&mdash;asked after her present health;
and then, satisfied that he had acquitted himself of his
whole duty, withdrew into the distant depths of his
own soul and fumbled over the papers Horace had
brought him, trying to familiarize himself with them,
as a commander might try to learn the faces of his
soldiers.</p>

<p>Then the two young people proceeded to find the
key together, and began a most harmonious duet.
Sand Hills was the theme. Thus it was that they had
to go out on the balcony, where Miss Rittenhouse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
might gaze into the brooding darkness over the sea,
and watch it wink a slow yellow eye with a humorous
alternation of sudden and brief red. Thus, also, Horace
had to explain how the lighthouse was constructed.
This moved Miss Rittenhouse to scientific research.
She must see how it was done. Mr. Walpole would
be delighted to show her. Papa was so much interested
in those mechanical matters. Mr. Walpole had
a team and light wagon at his disposal, and would very
much like to drive Miss Rittenhouse and her father
over to the lighthouse. Miss Rittenhouse communicated
this kind offer to her father. Her father saw
what was expected of him, and dutifully acquiesced,
like an obedient American father. Miss Rittenhouse
had managed the Rittenhouse household and the head
of the house of Rittenhouse ever since her mother’s
death.</p>

<p>Mr. Walpole really had a team at his disposal. He
came from a country where people do not chase foxes,
nor substitutes for foxes; but where they know and
revere a good trotter. He had speeded many a friend’s
horse in training for the county fair. When he came
to Sand Hills his soundness in the equine branch of a
gentleman’s education had attracted the attention of
a horsey Sand-Hiller, who owned a showy team with
a record of 2.37. This team was not to be trusted to the
ordinary summer boarder on any terms; but the Sand-Hiller
was thrifty and appreciative, and he lured Horace
into hiring the turnout at a trifling rate, and thus
captured every cent the boy had to spare, and got his
horses judiciously exercised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a showy light wagon to match the team,
and the next day the light wagon, with Horace and
the Rittenhouses in it, passed every carriage on the
road to the lighthouse, where Miss Rittenhouse satisfied
her scientific spirit with one glance at the lantern, after
giving which glance she went outside and sat in the
shade of the white tower with Horace, while the keeper
showed the machinery to the Judge. Perhaps she
went to the Judge afterward, and got him to explain it
all to her.</p>

<p>Thus it began, and for two golden weeks thus it went
on. The reorganized Breeze Hotel and Park Company
met in business session on its own property, and Horace
acted as a sort of honorary clerk to Judge Rittenhouse.
The company, as a company, talked over work
for a couple of hours each day. As a congregation of
individuals, it ate and drank and smoked and played
billiards and fished and slept the rest of the two dozen.
Horace had his time pretty much to himself, or rather
to Miss Rittenhouse, who monopolized it. He drove
her to the village to match embroidery stuffs. He
danced with her in the evenings when two stolidly soulful
Germans, one with a fiddle and the other with a
piano, made the vast dining-room ring and hum with
Suppé and Waldteufel,&mdash;and this was to the great
and permanent improvement of his waltzing. She
taught him how to play lawn-tennis&mdash;he was an old-fashioned
boy from the backwoods, and he thought
that croquet was still in existence, so she had to teach
him to play lawn-tennis&mdash;until he learned to play
much better than she could. On the other hand, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
was a fresh-water swimmer of rare wind and wiriness,
and a young sea-god in the salt, as soon as he got used
to its pungent strength. So he taught her to strike
out beyond the surf-line, with broad, breath-long
sweeps, and there to float and dive and make friends
with the ocean. Even he taught her to fold her white
arms behind her back, and swim with her feet. As he
glanced over his shoulder to watch her following him,
and to note the timorous, admiring crowd on the
shore, she seemed a sea-bred Venus of Milo in blue serge.</p>

<p>I have known men to be bored by such matters.
They made Horace happy. He was happiest, perhaps,
when he found out that she was studying Latin. All
the girls in Philadelphia were studying Latin that
summer. They had had a little school Latin, of course;
but now their aims were loftier. Miss Rittenhouse had
brought with her a Harkness’s Virgil, an Anthon’s
dictionary, an old Bullion &amp; Morris, and&mdash;yes, when
Horace asked her, she had brought an Interlinear; but
she didn’t mean to use it. They rowed out to the
buoy, and put the Interlinear in the sea. They sat on
the sands after the daily swim, and enthusiastically
labored, with many an unclassic excursus, over P. V.
Maronis Opera. Horace borrowed some books of a
small boy in the hotel, and got up at five o’clock in the
morning to run a couple of hundred lines or so ahead
of his pupil, “getting out” a stint that would have
made him lead a revolt had any teacher imposed it
upon his class a few years before&mdash;for he was fresh
enough from schooling to have a little left of the little
Latin that colleges give.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>He wondered how it was that he had never seen the
poetry of the lines before. <i lang="la">Forsan et hæc olim
meminisse juvabit</i>&mdash;for perchance it will joy us hereafter
to remember these things! He saw the wet and
weary sailors on the shore, hungrily eating, breathing
hard after their exertions; he heard the deep cheerfulness
of their leader’s voice. The wind blew toward
him over the pine barrens, as fresh as ever it blew past
Dido’s towers. A whiff of briny joviality and adventurous
recklessness seemed to come from the page on
his knee. And to him, also, had not She appeared
who saw, hard by the sea, that pious old buccaneer-Lothario,
so much tossed about on land and upon the
deep?</p>

<p>This is what the moderns call a flirtation, and I do
not doubt that it was called a flirtation by the moderns
around these two young people. Somehow, though,
they never got themselves “talked about,” not even by
the stranded nomads on the hotel verandas. Perhaps
this was because there was such a joyous freshness and
purity about both of them that it touched the hearts
of even the slander-steeped old dragons who rocked all
day in the shade, and embroidered tidies and talked ill
of their neighbors. Perhaps it was because they also
had that about them which the mean and vulgar mind
always sneers at, jeers at, affects to disbelieve in, always
recognizes and fears,&mdash;the courage and power of the
finer strain. Envy in spit-curls and jealousy in a false
front held their tongues, may be, because, though they
knew that they, and even their male representatives,
were safe from any violent retort, yet they recognized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the superior force, and shrunk from it as the cur edges
away from the quiescent whip.</p>

<p>There is a great difference, too, between the flirtations
of the grandfatherless and the flirtations of the
grandfathered. I wish you to understand that Mr.
Walpole and Miss Rittenhouse did not <em>sprawl</em> through
their flirtation, nor fall into that slipshod familiarity
which takes all the delicate beauty of dignity and mutual
respect out of such a friendship. Horace did not
bow to the horizontal, and Miss Rittenhouse did not
make a cheese-cake with her skirts when he held open
the door for her to pass through; but the bond of
courtesy between them was no less sweetly gracious on
her side, no less finely reverential on his, than the
taste of their grandparents’ day would have exacted,&mdash;no
less earnest, I think, that it was a little easier than
puff and periwig might have made it.</p>

<p>Yet I also think, whatever was the reason that made
the dragons let them alone, that a simple mother of the
plain, old-fashioned style is better for a girl of Miss
Rosamond Rittenhouse’s age than any such precarious
immunity from annoyance.</p>

<p>Ah, the holiday was short! The summons soon came
for Horace. They went to the old church together for
the second and last time, and he stood beside her, and
they held the hymn-book between them.</p>

<p>Horace could not rid himself of the idea that they
had stood thus through every Sunday of a glorious
summer. The week before he had sung with her. He
had a boyish baritone in him, one of those which may
be somewhat extravagantly characterized as consisting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
wholly of middle register. It was a good voice for the
campus, and, combined with that startling clearness of
utterance which young collegians acquire, had been
very effective in the little church. But to-day he had
no heart to sing “Byefield” and “Pleyel”; he would
rather stand beside her and feel his heart vibrate to
the deep lower notes of her tender contralto, and his
soul rise with the higher tones that soared upward
from her pure young breast. And all the while he was
making that act of devotion which&mdash;“uttered or unexpressed”&mdash;is,
indeed, all the worship earth has ever
known.</p>

<p>Once she looked up at him as if she asked, “Why
don’t you sing?” But her eyes fell quickly, he thought
with a shade of displeasure in them at something they
had seen in his. Yet as he watched her bent head, the
cheek near him warmed with a slow, soft blush. He
may only have fancied that her clear voice quivered a
little with a tremolo not written in the notes at the top
of the page.</p>

<p>And now the last day came. When the work-a-day
world thrust its rough shoulder into Arcadia, and the
hours of the idyll were numbered, they set to talking
of it as though the two weeks that they had known
each other were some sort of epitomized summer. Of
course they were to meet again, in New York or in
Philadelphia; and of course there were many days
of summer in store for Miss Rittenhouse at Sand Hills,
at Newport, and at Mount Desert; but Horace’s brief
season was closed, and somehow she seemed to fall
readily into his way of looking upon it as a golden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
period of special and important value, their joint and
exclusive property&mdash;something set apart from all the
rest of her holiday, where there would be other men
and other good times and no Horace.</p>

<p>It was done with much banter and merriment; but
through it all Horace listened for delicate undertones
that should echo to his ear the earnestness which sometimes
rang irrepressibly in his own speech. In that
marvellous instrument, a woman’s voice, there are
strange and fine possibilities of sound that may be the
messengers of the subtlest intelligence or the sweet
falterings of imperfect control. So Horace, with love
to construe for him, did not suffer too cruelly from
disappointment.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of that last day they sat upon the
beach and saw the smoke of Dido’s funeral pile go up,
and they closed the dog’s-eared Virgil, and, looking
seaward, watched the black cloud from a coaling steamer
mar the blinding blue where sea and sky blent at the
horizon; watched it grow dull and faint, and fade away,
and the illumined turquoise reassert itself.</p>

<p>Then he was for a farewell walk, and she, with that
bright acquiescence with which a young girl can make
companionship almost perfect, if she will, accepted it
as an inspiration, and they set out. They visited together
the fishermen’s houses, where Horace bade good-bye
to mighty-fisted friends, who stuck their thumbs
inside their waistbands and hitched their trousers half
way up to their blue-shirted arms, and said to him,
“You come up here in Orgust, Mr. Walpole&mdash;say
’bout the fus’ t’ the third week ’n Orgust, ’n’ we’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
give yer some bloo-fishin’ ’t y’ won’t need t’ lie about,
neither.” They all liked him, and heartily.</p>

<p>Old Rufe, the gruff hermit of the fishers, who lived
a half-mile beyond the settlement, flicked his shuttle
through the net he was mending, and did not look up
as Horace spoke to him.</p>

<p>“Goin’?” he said; “waal, we’ve all gotter go some
time oruther. The’ aint no real perma-nen-cy on this
uth. Goin’? Waal, I’m”&mdash;he paused, and weighed
the shuttle in his hand as though to aid him in balancing
some important mental process. “Sho! I’m derned
’f I ain’t sorry. Squall comin’ up, an’ don’t y’ make no
mistake,” he hurried on, not to be further committed
to unguarded expression; “better look sharp, or y’ ’ll
git a wettin’.”</p>

<p>A little puff of gray cloud, scurrying along in the
south-east, had spread over half the sky, and now came
a strong, eddying wind. A big raindrop made a dark
spot on the sand before them; another fell on Miss
Rittenhouse’s cheek, and then, with a vicious, uncertain
patter, the rain began to come down.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to run for Poinsett’s,” said Horace, and
stretched out his hand. She took it, and they ran.</p>

<p>Poinsett’s was just ahead&mdash;a white house on a lift
of land, close back of the shore-line, with a long garden
stretching down in front, and two or three poplar trees.
The wind was turning up the pale under-sides of grass-blade
and flower leaf, and whipping the shivering
poplars silver white. Cap’n Poinsett, late of Gloucester,
Massachusetts, was tacking down the path in his
pea-jacket, with his brass telescope tucked under his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
arm. He was making for the little white summer-house
that overhung the shore; but he stopped to
admire the two young people dashing up the slope
toward him, for the girl ran with a splendid free stride
that kept her well abreast of Horace’s athletic lope.</p>

<p>“Come in,” he said, opening the gate, and smiling
on the two young faces, flushed and wet; “come right
in out o’ the rain. Be’n runnin’, ain’t ye? Go right
int’ the house. Mother!” he called, “here’s Mr. Walpole
’n’ his young lady. You’ll hev to ex-cuse me;
I’m a-goin’ down t’ my observa<i>tor</i>y. I carn’t foller
the sea no longer myself, but I can look at them that
dooz. There’s my old woman&mdash;go right in.”</p>

<p>He waddled off, leaving both of them redder than
their run accounted for, and Mrs. Poinsett met them at
the door, her arms folded in her apron.</p>

<p>“Walk right in,” she greeted them; “the cap’n he
mus’ always go down t’ his observa<i>tor</i>y, ’s he calls it,
’n’ gape through thet old telescope of hisn, fust thing
the’s a squall&mdash;jus’s if he thought he was skipper of
all Long Island. But you come right int’ the settin’-room
’n’ make yourselves to home. Dear me suz!
’f I’d ’a’ thought I’d ’a’ had company I’d ’a’ tidied
things up. I’m jus’ ’s busy <em>as</em> busy, gettin’ supper
ready; but don’t you mind <em>me</em>&mdash;jus’ you make yourselves
to home,” and she drifted chattering away, and
they heard her in the distant kitchen amiably nagging
the hired girl.</p>

<p>It was an old-time, low-ceiled room, neat with New
England neatness. The windows had many panes of
green flint glass, through which they saw the darkening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
storm swirl over the ocean and ravage the flower-beds
near by.</p>

<p>And when they had made an end of watching Cap’n
Poinsett in his little summer-house, shifting his long
glass to follow each scudding sail far out in the darkness;
and when they had looked at the relics of Cap’n
Poinsett’s voyages to the Orient and the Arctic, and
at the cigar-boxes plastered with little shells, and at
the wax fruit, and at the family trousers and bonnets
in the album, there was nothing left but that Miss
Rittenhouse should sit down at the old piano, bought
for Amanda Jane in the last year of the war, and bring
forth rusty melody from the yellowed keys.</p>

<p>“What a lovely voice she has!” thought Horace as
she sang. No doubt he was right. I would take his
word against that of a professor of music, who would
have told you that it was a nice voice for a girl, and
that the young woman had more natural dramatic
expression than technical training.</p>

<p>They fished out Amanda Jane’s music-books, and
went through “Juanita,” and the “Evergreen Waltz,”
and “Beautiful Isle of the Sea;” and, finding a lot of
war songs, severally and jointly announced their determination
to invade Dixie Land, and to annihilate Rebel
Hordes; and adjured each other to remember Sumter
and Baltimore, and many other matters that could have
made but slight impression on their young minds twenty
odd years before. Mrs. Poinsett, in the kitchen, stopped
nagging her aid, and thought of young John Tarbox Poinsett’s
name on a great sheet of paper in the Gloucester
post-office, one morning at the end of April, 1862, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the news came up that Farragut had passed the
forts.</p>

<p>The squall was going over, much as it had come,
only no one paid attention to its movements now, for
the sun was out, trying to straighten up the crushed
grass and flowers, and to brighten the hurrying
waves, and to soothe the rustling agitation of the
poplars.</p>

<p>They must have one more song. Miss Rittenhouse
chose “Jeannette and Jeannot,” and when she looked
back at him with a delicious coy mischief in her eyes,
and sang,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“There is no one left to love me now,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And you too may forget”&mdash;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Horace felt something flaming in his cheeks and choking
in his breast, and it was hard for him to keep from
snatching those hands from the keys and telling her
she knew better.</p>

<p>But he was man enough not to. He controlled himself,
and made himself very pleasant to Mrs. Poinsett
about not staying to supper, and they set out for the
hotel.</p>

<p>The air was cool and damp after the rain.</p>

<p>“You’ve been singing,” said Horace, “and you will
catch cold in this air, and lose your voice. You must
tie this handkerchief around your throat.”</p>

<p>She took his blue silk handkerchief and tied it around
her throat, and wore it until just as they were turning
away from the shore, when she took it off to return to
him; and the last gust of wind that blew that afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
whisked it out of her hand, and sent it whirling
a hundred yards out to sea.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t say a word,” said Horace; “it isn’t of
the slightest consequence.”</p>

<p>But he looked very gloomy over it. He had made
up his mind that that silk handkerchief should be the
silk handkerchief of all the world to him, from that
time on.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was one month later that Mr. H. K. Walpole
received, in care of Messrs. Weeden, Snowden &amp; Gilfeather,
an envelope postmarked Newport, containing
a red silk handkerchief. His initials were neatly&mdash;nay,
beautifully, exquisitely&mdash;stitched in one corner.
But there was absolutely nothing about the package to
show who sent it, and Horace sorrowed over this. Not
that he was in any doubt; but he felt that it meant to
say that he must not acknowledge it; and, loyally, he
did not.</p>

<p>And he soon got over that grief. The lost handkerchief,
whose origin was base and common, like other
handkerchiefs, and whose sanctity was purely accidental&mdash;what
was it to <em>this</em> handkerchief, worked by her
for him?</p>

<p>This became the outward and visible sign of the inward
and spiritual grace that had changed the boy’s
whole life. Before this he had had purposes and ambitions.
He had meant to take care of his mother, to do
well in the world, and to restore, if he could, the honor
and glory of the home his father had left him. Here
were duty, selfishness, and an innocent vanity. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
now he had an end in life, so high that the very seeking
of it was a religion. Every thought of self was
flooded out of him, and what he sought he sought in a
purer and nobler spirit than ever before.</p>

<p>Is it not strange? A couple of weeks at the sea-side,
a few evenings under the brooding darkness of hotel
verandas, the going to and fro of a girl with a sweet
face, and this ineradicable change is made in the mind
of a man who has forty or fifty years before him wherein
to fight the world, to find his place, to become a factor
for good or evil.</p>

<p>And here we have Horace, with his heart full of love
and his head full of dreams, mooning over a silk handkerchief,
in open court.</p>

<p>Not that he often took such chances. The daws of
humor peck at the heart worn on the sleeve; and quite
rightly, for that is no place for a heart. But in the
privacy of his modest lodging-house room he took the
handkerchief out, and spread it before him, and looked
at it, and kissed it sometimes, I suppose,&mdash;it seems
ungentle to pry thus into the sacredness of a boy’s
love,&mdash;and, certainly, kept it in sight, working, studying,
or thinking.</p>

<p>With all this, the handkerchief became somewhat
rumpled, and at last Horace felt that it must be
brought back to the condition of neatness in which he
first knew it. So, on a Tuesday, he descended to the
kitchen of his lodging-house, and asked for a flat-iron.
His good landlady, at the head of an industrious, plump-armed
Irish brigade, all vigorously smoothing out towels,
stared at him in surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“If there’s anything you want ironed, Mr. Walpole,
bring it down here, and I’ll be <em>more’n</em> glad to iron it
for you.”</p>

<p>Horace grew red, and found his voice going entirely
out of his control, as he tried to explain that it wasn’t
for that&mdash;it wasn’t for ironing clothes&mdash;he was sure
nobody could do it but himself.</p>

<p>“Do you want it hot or cold?” asked Mrs. Wilkins,
puzzled.</p>

<p>“Cold!” said Horace desperately. And he got it
cold, and had to heat it at his own fire to perform his
labor of love.</p>

<p>That was of a piece with many things he did. Of a
piece, for instance, with his looking in at the milliners’
windows and trying to think which bonnet would best
become her&mdash;and then taking himself severely to task
for dreaming that she would wear a ready-made bonnet.
Of a piece with his buying two seats for the theatre,
and going alone and fancying her next him, and glancing
furtively at the empty place at the points where
he thought she would be amused, or pleased, or moved.</p>

<p>What a fool he was! Yes, my friend, and so are
you and I. And remember that this boy’s foolishness
did not keep him tossing, stark awake, through ghastly
nights; did not start him up in the morning with a hot
throat and an unrested brain; did not send him down
to his day’s work with the haunting, clutching, lurking
fear that springs forward at every stroke of the clock,
at every opening of the door. Perhaps you and I have
known folly worse than his.</p>

<p>Through all the winter&mdash;the red handkerchief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
cheered the hideous first Monday in October, and the
Christmas holidays, when business kept him from going
home to Montevista&mdash;he heard little or nothing
of her. His friends in the city, or rather his father’s
friends, were all ingrained New Yorkers, dating from
the provincial period, who knew not Philadelphia; and
it was only from an occasional newspaper paragraph
that he learned that Judge Rittenhouse and his daughter
were travelling through the South, for the Judge’s
health. Of course, he had a standing invitation to call
on them whenever he should find himself in Philadelphia;
but they never came nearer Philadelphia than
Washington, and so he never found himself in Philadelphia.
He was not so sorry for this as you might
think a lover should be. He knew that, with a little
patience, he might present himself to Judge Rittenhouse
as something more than a lawyer’s managing
clerk.</p>

<p>For, meanwhile, good news had come from home, and
things were going well with him. Mineral springs had
been discovered at Aristotle&mdash;mineral springs may be
discovered anywhere in north New York, if you only
try; though it is sometimes difficult to fit them with
the proper Indian legends. The name of the town had
been changed to Avoca, and there was already an Avoca
Improvement Company, building a big hotel, advertising
right and left, and prophesying that the day of
Saratoga and Sharon and Richfield was ended. So
the barrens between Montevista and Aristotle, skirting
the railroad, suddenly took on a value. Hitherto they
had been unsalable, except for taxes. For the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
part they were an adjunct of the estate of Montevista;
and in February Horace went up to St. Lawrence
County and began the series of sales that was to realize
his father’s most hopeless dream, and clear Montevista
of all incumbrances.</p>

<p>How pat it all came, he thought, as, on his return
trip, the train carried him past the little old station, with
its glaring new sign, AVOCA, just beyond the broad
stretch of “Squire Walpole’s bad land,” now sprouting
with the surveyors’ stakes. After all was paid off on
the old home, there would be enough left to enable
him to buy out Haskins, who had openly expressed his
desire to get into a “live firm,” and who was willing
to part with his interest for a reasonable sum down,
backed up by a succession of easy installments. And
Judge Weeden had intimated, as clearly as dignity
would permit, his anxiety that Horace should seize the
opportunity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Winter was still on the Jersey flats on the last day
of March; but Horace, waiting at a little “flag station,”
found the air full of crude prophecies of spring. He
had been searching titles all day, in a close and gloomy
little town-hall, and he was glad to be out-of-doors
again, and to think that he should be back in New York
by dinner time, for it was past five o’clock.</p>

<p>But a talk with the station-master made the prospect
less bright. No train would stop there until seven.</p>

<p>Was there no other way of getting home? The
lonely guardian of the Gothic shanty thought it over,
and found that there was a way. He talked of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
trains as though they were whimsical creatures under
his charge.</p>

<p>“The’s a freight comin’ down right now,” he said,
meditatively, “but I can’t do nothin’ with her. She’s
gotter get along mighty lively to keep ahead of the
Express from Philadelphia till she gets to the junction
and goes on a siding till the Express goes past. And
as to the Express&mdash;why, I couldn’t no more flag her
than if she was a cyclone. But I tell you what you
do. You walk right down to the junction&mdash;’bout a
mile ’n’ a half down&mdash;and see if you can’t do something
with number ninety-seven on the other road.
You see, she goes on to New York on our tracks, and
she mostly’s in the habit of waiting at the junction
’bout&mdash;say five to seven minutes, to give that Express
from Philadelphia a fair start. That Express has it
pretty much her own way on this road, for a fact.
You go down to the junction&mdash;walk right down the
line&mdash;and you’ll get ninety-seven&mdash;there ain’t no kind
of doubt about it. You can’t see the junction; but
it’s just half a mile beyont that curve down there.”</p>

<p>So there was nothing to be done but to walk to the
junction. The railroad ran a straight, steadily descending
mile on the top of a high embankment, and then
suddenly turned out of sight around a ragged elevation.
Horace buttoned his light overcoat, and tramped down
the cinder-path between the tracks.</p>

<p>Yes, spring was coming. The setting sun beamed a
soft, hopeful red over the shoulder of the ragged elevation;
light, drifting mists rose from the marsh land
below him, and the last low rays struck a vapory opal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
through them. There was a warm, almost prismatic
purple hanging over the outlines of the hills and woods
far to the east. The damp air, even, had a certain languid
warmth in it; and though there was snow in the
little hollows at the foot of the embankment, and bits
of thin whitish ice were in the swampy pools, it was clear
enough to Horace that spring was at hand. Spring&mdash;and
then summer; and, by the sea or in the mountains,
the junior partner of the house of Weeden, Snowden
&amp; Gilfeather might hope to meet once more with Judge
Rittenhouse’s daughter.</p>

<p>The noise of the freight-train, far up the track behind
him, disturbed Horace’s springtime revery. A forethought
of rocking gravel-cars scattering the overplus
of their load by the way, and of reeking oil-tanks,
filling the air with petroleum, sent him down the
embankment to wait until the way was once more
clear.</p>

<p>The freight-train went by and above him with a long-drawn
roar and clatter, and with a sudden fierce crash,
and the shriek of iron upon iron, at the end, and the
last truck of the last car came down the embankment,
tearing a gully behind it, and ploughed a grave for
itself in the marsh ten yards ahead of him.</p>

<p>And, looking up, he saw a twisted rail raising its
head like a shining serpent above the dim line of the
embankment. A furious rush took Horace up the slope.
A quarter of a mile below him the freight-train was
slipping around the curve. The fallen end of the last
car was beating and tearing the ties. He heard the
shrill creak of the brakes and the frightened whistle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the locomotive. But the grade was steep, and it was
hard to stop. And if they did stop they were half a
mile from the junction&mdash;half a mile from their only
chance of warning the Express.</p>

<p>Horace heard in his ears the station-master’s words:
“She’s gotter get along mighty lively to keep ahead
of the Express from Philadelphia.”</p>

<p>“Mighty lively&mdash;mighty lively,”&mdash;the words rang
through his brain to the time of thundering car-wheels.</p>

<p>He knew where he stood. He had made three-quarters
of the straight mile. He was three-quarters
of a mile, then, from the little station. His overcoat
was off in half a second. Many a time had he stripped,
with that familiar movement, to trunks and sleeveless
shirt, to run his mile or his half-mile; but never had
such a thirteen hundred yards lain before him, up such
a track, to be run for such an end.</p>

<p>The sweat was on his forehead before his right foot
passed his left.</p>

<p>His young muscles strove and stretched. His feet
struck the soft, unstable path of cinders with strong,
regular blows. His tense forearms strained upward
from his sides. Under his chest, thrown outward from
his shoulders, was a constricting line of pain. His wet
face burnt. There was a fire in his temples, and at
every breath of his swelling nostrils something throbbed
behind his eyes. The eyes saw nothing but a dancing
dazzle of tracks and ties, through a burning blindness.
And his feet beat, beat, beat till the shifting cinders
seemed afire under him.</p>

<p>That is what this human machine was doing, going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
at this extreme pressure; every muscle, every breath,
every drop of blood alive with the pain of this intense
stress. Looking at it you would have said, “A fleet,
light-limbed young man, with a stride like a deer,
throwing the yards under him in fine style.” All we
know about the running other folks are making in this
world!</p>

<p>Half-way up the track Horace stopped short, panting
hard, his heart beating like a crazy drum, a nervous
shiver on him. Up the track there was a dull whirr,
and he saw the engine of the express-train slipping
down on him&mdash;past the station already.</p>

<p>The white mists from the marshes had risen up over
the embankment. The last rays of the sunset shot
through them, brilliant and blinding. Horace could
see the engine; but would the engineer see him, waving
his hands in futile gestures, in time to stop on that
slippery, sharp grade? And of what use would be his
choking voice when the dull whirr should turn into a
roar? For a moment, in his hopeless disappointment,
Horace felt like throwing himself in the path of the
train, like a wasted thing that had no right to live,
after so great a failure.</p>

<p>As will happen to those who are stunned by a great
blow, his mind ran back mechanically to the things
nearest his heart, and in a flash he went through the
two weeks of his life. And then, before the thought
had time to form itself, he had brought a red silk
handkerchief from his breast, and was waving it with
both hands, a fiery crimson in the opal mist.</p>

<p>Seen. The whistle shrieked; there was a groan and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
a creak of brakes, the thunder of the train resolved
itself into various rattling noises, the engine slipped
slowly by him, and slowed down, and he stood by the
platform of the last car as the express stopped.</p>

<p>There was a crowd around Horace in an instant.
His head was whirling, but in a dull way he said what
he had to say. An officious passenger, who would
have explained it all to the conductor if the conductor
had waited, took the deliverer in his arms&mdash;for the boy
was near fainting&mdash;and enlightened the passengers
who flocked around.</p>

<p>Horace hung in his embrace, too deadly weak even
to accept the offer of one of the dozen flasks that were
thrust at him. Nothing was very clear in his mind; as
far as he could make out, his most distinct impression
was of a broad, flat beach, a blue sea and a blue sky,
a black steamer making a black trail of smoke across
them, and a voice soft as an angel’s reading Latin close
by him. Then he opened his eyes and saw the woman
of the voice standing in front of him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Richard,” he heard her say,“it’s Mr. Walpole!”</p>

<p>Horace struggled to his feet. She took his hand in
both of hers and drew closer to him; the crowd falling
back a little, seeing that they were friends.</p>

<p>“What can I ever say to thank you?” she said.
“You have saved our lives. It’s not so much for
myself, but”&mdash;she blushed faintly, and Horace felt
her hands tremble on his; “Richard&mdash;my husband&mdash;we
were married to-day, you know&mdash;and”&mdash;</p>

<p>Something heavy and black came between Horace
and life for a few minutes. When it passed away he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
straightened himself up out of the arms of the officious
passenger and stared about him, mind and memory
coming back to him. The people around looked at
him oddly. A brakeman brought him his overcoat,
and he stood unresistingly while it was slipped on
him. Then he turned away and started down the
embankment.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” cried the officious passenger excitedly;
“we’re getting up a testimonial”&mdash;</p>

<p>Horace never heard it. How he found his way he
never cared to recall; but the gas was dim in the city
streets, and the fire was out in his little lodging-house
room when he came home; and his narrow white bed
knows all that I cannot tell of his tears and his broken
dreams.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Walpole,” said Judge Weeden, as he stood between
the yawning doors of the office safe, one morning
in June, “I observe that you have a private package
here. Why do you not use the drawer of our&mdash;our
late associate, Mr. Haskins? It is yours now, you
know. I’ll put your package in it.” He poised the
heavily sealed envelope in his hand. “Very odd
<em>feeling</em> package, Walpole. Remarkably soft!” he said.
“Well, bless me, it’s none of my business, of course.
Horace, how much you look like your father!”</p>

<h2 id="THE_SEVEN_CONVERSATIONS">THE SEVEN CONVERSATIONS<br />
<span class="smaller">OF</span><br />
DEAR JONES AND BABY VAN RENSSELAER.</h2>

<p class="author">BY BRANDER MATTHEWS AND H. C. BUNNER.</p>

<h3>I.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE FIRST CONVERSATION.</span></h3>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Tuesday</span>, February 14, 1882.</p>

<p>The band was invisible, but, unfortunately, not inaudible.
It was in the butler’s pantry, playing
Waldteufel’s latest waltz, “Süssen Veilchen.” The
English butler, who resented the intrusion of the German
leader, was introducing an <i lang="it">obbligato</i> unforeseen by
the composer. This was the second of Mrs. Martin’s
charming Tuesdays in February. Mrs. Martin herself,
fondly and familiarly known as the “Duchess of Washington
Square,” stopped a young man as he was making
a desperate rush for his overcoat, then reposing
under three strata of late comers’ outer garments in the
second-floor back, and said to him:</p>

<p>“O Dear Jones”&mdash;the Duchess always called him
Dear Jones&mdash;“I want to introduce you to Baby Van
Rensselaer&mdash;Phyllis Van Rensselaer, you know&mdash;they
always called her Baby Van Rensselaer, though I’m
sure I don’t know why&mdash;Phyllis is such a lovely name&mdash;don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
you think so?&mdash;and your grandfathers were
such friends.” [Dear Jones executed an <i lang="la">ex post facto</i>
condemnation upon his ancestor and hers.] “You know
Major Van Rensselaer was your grandfather’s partner
until that unfortunate affair of the embezzlement&mdash;O
Baby dear&mdash;there you are, are you? I was wondering
where you were all this time. This is Mr. Jones, dear,
one of your grandfather’s most intimate friends. Oh,
I don’t mean that, of course&mdash;you know what I mean&mdash;and
I do so want you two to know each other.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: What in the name of the prophet does
the Duchess mean by introducing me to More Girls?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: I do wish the Duchess
wouldn’t insist on tiring me out with slim young men;
I never can tell one from the other.</p>

<p class="hanging">These remarks were not uttered. They remained in
the privacy of the inner consciousness. What they
really said was:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span> [<i>inarticulately</i>]: Miss Van Rensselaer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span> [<i>inattentively</i>]: Yes, it is
rather warm.…</p>

<p>And they drifted apart in the crowd.</p>

<h3>II.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SECOND CONVERSATION.</span></h3>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Thursday</span>, April 13, 1882.</p>

<p>Of course, Dear Jones was the last to arrive of the
favored children of the world who had been invited to
dine at Judge Gillespie’s “to meet the Lord Bishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
of Barset,” just imported from England per steamer
“Servia.” In the hall, the butler, whose appearance
was even more dignified and clerical than the Bishop’s,
handed Dear Jones an unsealed communication.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span> [<i>examining the contents</i>]: Who in
Heligoland is Miss Van Rensselaer?</p>

<p>As Dear Jones entered, Mrs. Sutton&mdash;the Judge’s
daughter, you know&mdash;married Charley Sutton, who
came from San Francisco&mdash;Mrs. Sutton gave a little
sigh of relief, nodded to the butler, and said in perfunctory
answer to the apologies Dear Jones had not
made: “Oh, no; you’re not a bit late&mdash;we haven’t
been waiting for you at all&mdash;the Bishop has only just
come”&mdash;(confidentially in his ear) “I’ve given you a
charming girl.” [Dear Jones shuddered: he knew what
that generally meant.] “You know Baby Van Rensselaer?
Of course&mdash;there she is&mdash;now, go&mdash;and do
be bright and clever.” And after thus handicapping
an inoffensive young man, she took the Bishop’s arm in
the middle of his ante-prandial anecdote.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span> [<i>marching to his fate</i>]: It’s the
Duchess’s girl again, by Jove! It’s lucky Uncle
Larry is going to take me off at ten sharp.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: Why, it’s <em>that</em> Mr.
Jones!</p>

<p class="hanging">These remarks were not uttered. They remained in
the privacy of the inner consciousness. What they
really said was:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span> [<i>with audacious hypocrisy</i>]: Of course,
<em>you</em> don’t remember me, Miss Van Rensselaer.…</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span> [<i>trumping his card unabashed</i>]:
I really don’t quite.…</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span> [<i>offering his arm</i>]: Er … don’t you
remember the Duch&mdash;Mrs. Martin’s&mdash;that hideously
rainy afternoon, just before Lent?</p>

<p>Here there was a gap in the conversation as the procession
took up its line of march, and moved through
a narrow passage into the dining-room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span> [<i>making a brave dash at the “bright
and clever”</i>]: Well, in <em>my</em> house, the door into the
dining-room shall be eighteen feet wide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span> [<i>literal, stern, and cold</i>]:
Are you building a house, Mr. Jones?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span> [<i>calmly</i>]: I am at present, Miss Van
Rensselaer, building&mdash;let me see&mdash;four&mdash;five&mdash;seven
houses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span> [<i>coldly and suspecting
flippancy</i>]: Ah, indeed&mdash;are you a billionaire?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: No; I’m an architect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span> [<i>in confusion</i>]: Oh, I’m
sure I beg your pardon&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: You needn’t. I shouldn’t be at all
ashamed to be a billionaire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: Oh, of course not&mdash;I
didn’t mean <em>that</em>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span> [<i>unguardedly</i>]: Well, if it comes to
that; I’m not ashamed of my architecture either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span> [<i>calmly</i>]: Indeed? I
have never seen any of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: You sit here, I think. This is your
card with the little lady in the powdered wig&mdash;a
cherubic Madame de Staël.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: And this is yours with a
Cupid in a basket&mdash;a nineteenth century Moses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span> [<i>taking his seat beside her</i>]: Talking
about dinner cards&mdash;and billionaires, you heard of
that dinner old Creasers gave to fifty-two of his friends
of the new dispensation. I believe there <em>was</em> one poor
fellow there whose wife had only half a peck of diamonds.
He assembled his hordes in the picture-gallery,
as the dining-room wasn’t large enough&mdash;you see, I
didn’t build <em>his</em> house. And to carry out the novelty
of the thing, his dinner cards were&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: Playing-cards?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: Just so&mdash;but they were painted,
“hand-painted” on satin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: And what did he take
for himself&mdash;the king of diamonds?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: For the only time in his life he forgot
himself&mdash;and he had to put up with the Joker.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: What sort of people were
there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: Very good sort, indeed. There was a
M. Meissonnier and M. Gérôme and a M. Corot&mdash;besides
the man who sold them to him.</p>

<p>Everybody knows how a conversation runs on at
dinner, when it does run on. On this occasion it ran
on for seventy minutes and six courses. Dear Jones
and Baby Van Rensselaer discussed the usual topics
and the usual bill-of-fare. Then, as the butler served
the bombe <i lang="fr">glacée à la Demidoff</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: Oh, I’m so glad you
liked her. We were at school together, you know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and she was with us when we went up the Saguenay
last August.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: Why, <em>I</em> went up the Saguenay last
August.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span> [<i>earnestly</i>]: And we didn’t
meet? How miserably absurd!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: I’ll tell you whom I did meet&mdash;your
father’s partner, Mr. Hitchcock. He had his daughter
with him, too&mdash;a very bright girl. You know her, of
course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span> [<i>coldly</i>]: I have heard she
is quite clever. [A pause.] The Hitchcocks&mdash;I
believe&mdash;go more in the&mdash;New England set. I have
met her brother, though&mdash;Mr. Mather Hitchcock.…</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: Mat Hitchcock; that little cad?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: Is he a little cad? I
thought he was rather&mdash;bright.</p>

<p>After this, conversation was desultory; and soon the
male guests were left to their untrammeled selves,
tobacco and the Bishop. At eleven minutes past ten,
in the vestibule of Judge Gillespie’s house, a young
man and a man not so young were buttoning their
overcoats and lighting their cigarettes. In the parlor
behind them a soft contralto voice was lingering on the
rich, deep notes of “Der Asra,” the sweetest song of
Jewish inspiration, the song of Heine and of Rubinstein.
They paused a moment as the voice died away
in</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Und mein Stamm sind jene Asra,</div>
<div class="verse">Welche sterben wenn sie lieben!”</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>
<p>The man not so young said: “Well, come along.
What are you waiting for?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: What the devil are you in such a
hurry for, Uncle Larry? It looked abominably rude
to leave those people in that way!</p>

<h3>III.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE THIRD CONVERSATION.</span></h3>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Tuesday</span>, May 30, 1882.</p>

<p>As the first band of the Decoration Day procession
struck up “Marching through Georgia” and marched
past Uncle Larry’s house, a cheerfully expectant
party filed out of the parlor windows upon the broad
stone balcony, draped with the flag that had floated
over the building for the four long years the day commemorated.
Uncle Larry had secured the Duchess to
matronize the annual gathering of young friends, the
final friendly meeting before the flight out of town;
and many of those who accepted him as the universal
uncle had accepted also this invitation. Dear Jones
and Baby Van Rensselaer were seated in the corner
of the balcony that caught the southern sun, Baby Van
Rensselaer, in Uncle Larry’s own study chair, while
Dear Jones was comfortably and gracefully perched on
the broad brown-stone railing of the balcony.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: Now, <em>doesn’t</em> that music
make your heart leap?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: M’&mdash;yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: You know I haven’t the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
least bit of sympathy with that affected talk about not
being moved by these things, and thinking it vulgar
and all that. I’m proud to say I love my country, and
I do love to see my country’s soldiers. Don’t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: M’&mdash;yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: Of course, I can’t really
remember anything about the war, but I try to pretend
to myself that I do remember when I was held up at
the window to see the troops marching back from the
grand review at Washington. (<i>Rather more softly.</i>)
Mama told me about it often before she died. And
“Marching through Georgia” always makes the tears
come to my eyes; don’t it yours?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: M’&mdash;yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: “Yes!” How queerly
you say that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span> (<i>grimly</i>): I’m rather more inclined to
cry when the band makes</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Stream and forest, hill and strand,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Reverberate with ‘Dixie.’”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span> (<i>coldly</i>): I’m afraid, Mr.
Jones, I do not understand you. And you appear to
have a very peculiar feeling about these things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span> [<i>rather absently</i>]: Well, yes, it is rather
a matter of feeling with me. Weak, I suppose&mdash;but
the fact is, Miss Van Rensselaer, it just breaks me up
to see all this. You know, the war hit me pretty hard.
I lost my brother in hospital after Seven Pines&mdash;and
then I lost my father, the best friend I ever had, at
Gettysburg, on the hill, you know, when he was leading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
his regiment, and his men couldn’t make him stay
back. So, you see, I wouldn’t have come here at all
to-day if&mdash;if&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: Oh, Mr. Jones, I’m <em>so
sorry</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span> [<i>surprised</i>]: Sorry? Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: I didn’t quite understand
you&mdash;but I do now. Why, you’re taking off
your hat. What is it? Oh, the battle-flags!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: My father’s regiment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span> [<i>to herself</i>]: I wonder
if that is the regiment I saw coming back from Washington?</p>

<h3>IV.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE FOURTH CONVERSATION.</span></h3>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Tuesday</span>, August 22, 1882.</p>

<p>The train rattled hotly along on its sultry journey
from one end of Long Island to the other, a journey the
half of which it had nearly accomplished with much
fuss and fret. Leaving his impediments of travel in
the smoker, Dear Jones entered the forward end of the
parlor car in search of an uncontaminated glass of
water. As he set down the glass he glanced along the
car, and his manner changed at once. He opened the
door for an instant and threw on the down track his
half-smoked cigarette; and then, smiling pleasantly, he
walked firmly down the car, past a rustic bridal couple,
and took a vacant seat just in front of Baby Van
Rensselaer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: Why, Mr. Jones!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: Why, Miss Van Rensselaer!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: Who would have thought
of seeing you here in this hot weather?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: Can I have this seat or is it that I
<i lang="fr">mank</i> at the <i lang="fr">convenances</i>&mdash;as the French say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: It’s Uncle Larry’s chair&mdash;he’s
gone back to talk to one of his vestrymen&mdash;he’s
taking me to Shelter Island.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: Shelter Island? How long are you
going to stay there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: And where are you going?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: I’m going to Sag Harbor to build a
house for one of my billionaires.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: Sag Harbor? What an
extraordinary place for a house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: Oh, that’s nothing. Last year I had
to build a house up in Chemung county.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: Chemung?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span> [<i>spelling it</i>]: C-h-e-m-u-n-g´&mdash;accent
on the mung. You probably call it Cheémung, but it
is really Sh’mung.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: Where is it? and how
do you get there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: By the <i lang="fr">Chemung de fer</i>, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: Oh, Mr. Jones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: You see, my mind is relaxed by the
effort to build a house on the model of the one occupied
by the old woman who lived in a shoe&mdash;and that variety
of early English architecture is very wearing on the
taste. What sort of a house is it you are going to at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Shelter Island? And how long are you going to stay
there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: Oh, it’s a stupid, old-fashioned
place [<i>pause</i>]. Do you think that bride is
pretty? I have been watching them ever since we
left New York. They have been to town on their
wedding-trip.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: She is ratherish pretty. And he’s a
shrewd fellow and likely to get on. I shouldn’t wonder
if he was the chief wire-puller of his “deestrick.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: A village Hampden?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: Some day he’ll withstand the little
tyrant of the fields and lead a revolt against the garden-sass
monopoly, and so sail into the legislature. I fear
the bride is destined to ruin her digestion in an Albany
boarding-house, while the groom gives his days and
nights to affairs of state.</p>

<p class="hanging">Here the train slackened its speed as it approached
a small station from which shrill notes of music
arose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: Look, the bride is going
to leave us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: He lives here, and the local fife and
drum corps have come to welcome him home. Dinna
ye hear that strident “Hail to the Chief,” they have
just executed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: How proudly she looks
up at him! I think the band ought to play something
for her&mdash;but they are men, and they’ll never think
of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: You cannot expect much tact from
two fifes and a bass drum, but unless my ears deceive
me they have greeted the bride with a well-meant
attempt at “Home, Sweet Home.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“And each responsive soul has heard</div>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span> [<i>surprised</i>]: Why&mdash;how did you
know that poem?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: Oh, I heard somebody
quote it last Decoration Day&mdash;I don’t know who&mdash;it
struck me as very pretty and I looked it up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span> [<i>pleased</i>]: Oh, I remember. It has
always been a favorite of mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span> [<i>coldly</i>]: Indeed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span> [<i>as the train starts again</i>]: Bride and
groom, fife and drum, fade away from sight and hearing.
I wonder if we shall ever think of them again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: I shall, I’m sure. She
was so pretty. And, besides, the music was lively. I
shan’t have anything half as amusing as that at Shelter
Island.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: Don’t you like it, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: Oh, dear no! I shall be
glad to get away to my aunt’s place at Watch Hill.
It’s very poky indeed, at Shelter Island (<i>sighs</i>). And
to think that I shall have to spend just two weeks of
primness and propriety there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: Just two weeks? Ah!</p>

<h3>V.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE FIFTH CONVERSATION.</span></h3>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Tuesday</span>, September 5, 1882. (Afternoon.)</p>

<p>Although it is difficult to tell the length from the
breadth of the small steamer that plies between Sag
Harbor and New London, it is safe to assume that it
was the bow that was pointing away from the Shelter
Island dock as Baby Van Rensselaer stepped out of
the cabin and Dear Jones walked up to her, lifting his
hat with an expression of surprise on his face that
might have been better, considering that he had rehearsed
it a number of times since he left Sag Harbor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: Why, Mr. Jones!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span> [<i>forgetting his lines, and improvising</i>]:
How&mdash;how&mdash;odd we should meet again just
here. Funny, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: It is exceedingly humorous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: I did not tell you, did I!&mdash;when I
saw you on the train, you know&mdash;that I had to go to
New London, after I’d finished my work at Sag Harbor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span> [<i>uncompromisingly</i>]: I
don’t think you said anything about New London
at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: I probably said the Pequot House.
It’s the same thing, you know. I have to go to New
London to inspect the Race Rock lighthouse&mdash;you’ve
heard of the famous lighthouse at Race Rock, of course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: I don’t think its fame has
reached me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: It’s a very curious structure, indeed.
And, the fact is, one of my&mdash;my billionaires&mdash;wants
a lighthouse. He has an extraordinary notion of building
a lighthouse near his place on the seashore&mdash;a
lighthouse of his own. Odd idea, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: It is a very odd proceeding
altogether, I should say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: I suppose you mean that <em>I</em> am a very
odd proceeding. Well, I will confess, and throw myself
on your mercy. I <em>did</em> hope to meet you&mdash;and
the Duch&mdash;Mrs. Martin. After two weeks of the society
of billionaires, I think I’m excusable.… [<i>A
painful pause.</i>] And I <em>had</em> to go to Race Rock, so
I got off a day earlier than I had meant to, by cutting
one of the turrets out of my original plan&mdash;he didn’t
mind&mdash;there are eleven left&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;will you
forgive me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: Really, I have nothing to
forgive, Mr. Jones. I’ve no doubt my aunt will be
very glad to see you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: Ah&mdash;how <em>is</em> Mrs. Martin?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: She is in the cabin. She
is quite well at present; but she is always very nervous
about sea-sickness, and she prefers to lie down. I must
go in and sit with her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span> [<i>quickly</i>]: Indeed&mdash;I didn’t know
Mrs. Martin suffered from sea-sickness. She’s crossed
the ocean so many times, you know. How many is
it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: Six, I think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: No; eight, isn’t it? I’m almost sure
it’s eight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: Very possibly. But she
is a great sufferer. I must go and see how she is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: Yes, we’ll go. I want to see Mrs.
Martin. One of the disadvantages of the summer season
is that one can’t see the Duchess at regular intervals
to exchange gossip.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: Well, if you have any
confidential gossip for the Duchess, I will wait here
until you come out. I want to get all the fresh air
possible, if I have to sit in the cabin for the rest of the
trip.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span> [<i>asserting himself</i>]: Very well. I
have the contents of four letters from Newport to
pour into the Duchess’s ear. You know I was staying
at the Hitchcocks’ for a fortnight, before I went to Sag
Harbor.</p>

<p>He went into the stuffy little cabin, where the Duchess
was lying on a bench, in a wilderness of shawls.
Baby Van Rensselaer waited a good half-hour, but
heard no sound of returning footsteps from that
gloomy cave. Finally she went in to investigate, and
was told by the Duchess that “Dear Jones has gone
after, or whatever you call it, to smoke a cigar.”
Baby Van Rensselaer made up her mind that under
those circumstances she would go forward and read
her book. She also made up her mind that Mr.
Jones was extremely rude. His rudeness, she found,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
as she sat reading at the bow of the boat, really spoiled
her book. She knew that she ought not to let such
little things annoy her; but then, it was a very stupid
chapter, and the fresh sea breeze blew the pages back
and forward, and her veil would not stay over her hair,
and she always had hated traveling, and it was so disagreeable
to have people behave in that way&mdash;especially
people&mdash;well, any people. Just here she turned
her head, and saw Dear Jones advancing from the
cabin with a bright and smiling face.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span> [<i>about to rise</i>]: My aunt
wants me, I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: Not at all&mdash;not in the least&mdash;at present.
I just came through the cabin&mdash;on tiptoe&mdash;and
she was fast asleep. In fact, not to speak it profanely,
she was&mdash;she was audible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: I’m glad to see you’re getting the
benefit of the fresh air.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: I was afraid of waking
my aunt with the rustling of the leaves of my book, so
I came out here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: I’m glad you did. It would be a
shame for you to have to sit in that close cabin.
That’s the reason I didn’t come back to you when
I left Mrs. Martin. I played a pious fraud on you for
the benefit of your health.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: You were very considerate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span> [<i>enthusiastically</i>]: Oh, not at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span> [<i>calmly</i>]: And if you’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
excuse me, I’ll finish my book. I can’t read in the
cabin.</p>

<p>Baby Van Rensselaer resumed her reading and
found the book improved a little. After a while she
looked up and saw Dear Jones sitting on the rail,
meekly twirling his thumbs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span> [<i>after an effort at silence</i>]:
Don’t be so ridiculously absurd. What are you doing
there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: I’m waiting to be spoken to.</p>

<p>Baby Van Rensselaer smiled. The boat had just
swung out of the jaws of the bay. Overhead was the
full glory of a sky which made one believe that there
never was such a thing as a cloud. And they sped
along over the sea of water in a sea of light. Just then
there came from the depths under the cabin the rise
and fall of a measured, mocking melody, high and
clear as the notes of a lark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: Why, that must be a
bird whistling&mdash;only birds don’t whistle “Amaryllis.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: ’Tisn’t a bird&mdash;it’s an engineer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: An engineer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: A grimy engineer. Quite a pathetic
story, too. Some of the Sag Harbor people took him
up as a boy. He had a wonderful ear and an extraordinary
tenor voice. They were going to make a
Mario of him. They paid for his education in New
York, and then sent him over to Paris to the Conservatory
to be finished off. And he hadn’t been there
six weeks before he caught the regular Paris pleurisy&mdash;it’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
an <i lang="fr">article de Paris</i>, you know, and lost his voice
utterly and hopelessly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: And so he had to come back and
engineer for his living.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: How very sad. Now I
can scarcely bear to hear him whistle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span> [<i>to himself</i>]: Well, I didn’t mean to
produce that effect. [<i>To her.</i>] Oh, he doesn’t mind
it a bit. Hear him now.</p>

<p class="hanging">The engineer was executing a series of brilliant variations
on the “Air du Roi Louis XIII.,” melting by ingenious
gradations into the “Babies on our Block.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span> [<i>hastily</i>]: Race Rock lies over that
way. You can’t see it yet&mdash;but you will after a while.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: Oh, then there <em>is</em> a Race
Rock?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: Why, certainly.…</p>

<p>With this starter, it may readily be understood that
a man of Dear Jones’s fecundity of intellect and fine
imaginative powers was able to fill the greater part of
the afternoon with fluent conversation. Two or three
times Baby Van Rensselaer made futile attempts to go
into the cabin to see how the Duchess was sleeping;
but as many times she forgot her errand. There was a
fair breeze blowing from the northeast, but the sea was
smooth, and the little boat scarcely rocked on the long,
low waves. It was getting toward four o’clock when
there was a sudden stoppage of the engineer’s whistling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
and of the machinery of the boat. Baby Van
Rensselaer sent Dear Jones back to inquire into the
cause, for they were alone on the broad sea, with only
a tantalizing glimpse of New London harbor stretching
out welcoming arms of green, with the Groton monument
stuck like a huge clothes-pin on the left arm.
Dear Jones came back, trying hard to look decently
perturbed and gloomy, but with a barbarian joy lighting
up his bronzed features.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: The machinery is on a dead centre.
And the whistling engineer says that he’ll have to
wait until he can get into port and hitch a horse to the
crank to start her off again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: But how are we to get
into port?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: The whistling engineer further says
that we are now drifting toward Watch Hill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: That’s just where we
want to go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: Yes. [<i>An unholy toot from the steam
whistle.</i>] And there he is signalling that yacht to take
us off!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: I must go to my aunt
now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: Why&mdash;there’s no hurry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: No, but she’ll be so
frightened&mdash;she’ll think it’s going to blow up or
something.</p>

<p>Baby Van Rensselaer disappeared in the depths of
the cabin. Dear Jones disconsolately walked the deck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
in solitary silence for five minutes. When Baby Van
Rensselaer reappeared, his spirits rose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: My aunt is afraid you
may have difficulty in reaching New London to-night.
She wants me to ask you if you won’t stay over-night
at her place at Watch Hill?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: Won’t I? Well, I will&mdash;have much
pleasure in accepting your aunt’s invitation.</p>

<h3>VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SIXTH CONVERSATION.</span></h3>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Tuesday</span>, September 5, 1882. (Evening.)</p>

<p>A row of Japanese lanterns shed a Cathayan light
along the little path leading from the Duchess’s house
on a rocky promontory to the little beach which nestled
under its shoulder. The moon softly and judiciously
lit up the baby breakers which in Long Island Sound
imitate the surf of the outer sea. It threw eerie
shadows behind the bath-houses, and fell with gentle
radiance upon two dripping but shapely figures emerging
from the water, where the other bathers were unwisely
lingering.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: I think this is simply delightful. I
really never got the perfect enjoyment of an evening
swim before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: I am glad you enjoyed it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: There is something so charming in
this aristocratic seclusion, with the shouts and laughter
of the vulgar herd just far enough off to be picturesque&mdash;if
you can call a noise picturesque.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span> [<i>coldly</i>]: I think this beach
might be a little more private&mdash;it’s shared in common
by these three cottages.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: But they seem to be very nice people
here. And they all swim so well, it quite put me on
my mettle. You are really a splendid swimmer, do
you know it? And that girl I towed out to the buoy,
who is she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span> [<i>explosively</i>]: Mr. Jones,
this is positively insulting!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: Wh&mdash;what&mdash;wh&mdash;why? I don’t
understand you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: To pretend that you don’t
know that Hitchcock woman!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span> [<i>innocently</i>]: Was that Miss Hitchcock?
I didn’t recognize her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: If this is your idea of
humor, Mr. Jones, it is simply offensive!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: But, upon my soul, I didn’t know the
girl&mdash;nor she me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: You didn’t know her?
After you have been staying two weeks at her house
at Newport?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span> [<i>with something like dignity</i>]: I was
staying at her father’s house, Miss Van Rensselaer,
and Miss Hitchcock was away on a visit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: Up the Saguenay, perhaps?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: Very likely. Miss Hitchcock may
have left a large part of the Saguenay unexplored for
all I know. I was introduced to her party only half
an hour before we got off the boat at Quebec.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: Long enough, however,
to discover that she was “bright.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: Quite long enough, Miss Van Rensselaer.
One may find out a great deal of another’s
character in half an hour.</p>

<p class="hanging">There was a pause, which was filled by the strains
of a Virginia reel, coming from one of the cottages
high up on the bank, where an impromptu dance was
just begun. The moonlight fell on Baby Van Rensselaer’s
little white teeth, set firmly between her parted
lips. The pause was broken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: If you propose to descend
to brutality of this sort, Mr. Jones, I think we need
prolong neither the conversation&mdash;nor the acquaintance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span> [<i>honestly</i>]: No&mdash;you can’t mean that&mdash;Miss
Van Rensselaer&mdash;Baby&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: What, sir! Your familiarity
is&mdash;I can’t stand familiarity from you! (<i>She
clenches her little hands.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: You have no right to treat me like
this. If I am familiar it is because I love you&mdash;and
you know it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: This is the first I have
heard of it, sir. I trust it will be the last. Will you
kindly permit me to pass, or must I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: You may go where you wish, Miss
Van Rensselaer&mdash;No, come, this is ridiculous&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: Is it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: I mean it is foolish. Don’t let us&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: Don’t let us see each
other again!</p>

<h3>VII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SEVENTH CONVERSATION.</span></h3>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Thursday</span>, February 14, 1884.</p>

<p>As the soft, low notes of the wedding-march from
“Lohengrin” fell gently from the organ-loft over the
entrance of Grace Church, the quartet of able-bodied
ushers passed up the centre aisle and parted the white
ribbons&mdash;a silken barrier which they had gallantly
defended for an hour in a vain effort to keep the
common herd of acquaintance separate from the chosen
many of the family. Behind them came two pretty
little girls, strewing the aisle with white flowers from
their aprons. The four bridesmaids, two abreast, passed
up the aisle after the little girls, proud in their reflected
glory. Then came the bride, leaning on Judge Gillespie’s
arm, and radiant with youth and beauty and
happiness. As the procession drew near the chancel-rail,
the groom came from the vestry and advanced to
meet her, accompanied by his best man, Uncle Larry,
who relieved him of his hat and overcoat, the which
he would dextrously return to him when the happy
couple should leave the church man and wife. And in
due time the Bishop asked, “Wilt thou have this
Woman to thy wedded wife?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jones</span>: I will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>The Bishop asked again, “Wilt thou have this Man
to thy wedded husband?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Van Rensselaer</span>: I will.</p>

<p class="hanging">As they knelt at the altar the sun came out and fell
through the window, and the stained glass sifted down
on them the mingled hues of hope and of faith and
love; and the Bishop blessed them.</p>

<h2 id="THE_RIVAL_GHOSTS">THE RIVAL GHOSTS.</h2>

<p class="author">BY BRANDER MATTHEWS.</p>

<p>The good ship sped on her way across the calm
Atlantic. It was an outward passage, according
to the little charts which the company had charily distributed,
but most of the passengers were homeward
bound, after a summer of rest and recreation, and they
were counting the days before they might hope to see
Fire Island Light. On the lee side of the boat, comfortably
sheltered from the wind, and just by the door
of the captain’s room (which was theirs during the day),
sat a little group of returning Americans. The Duchess
(she was down on the purser’s list as Mrs.
Martin, but her friends and familiars called her the
Duchess of Washington Square) and Baby Van Rensselaer
(she was quite old enough to vote, had her sex
been entitled to that duty, but as the younger of two
sisters she was still the baby of the family)&mdash;the
Duchess and Baby Van Rensselaer were discussing
the pleasant English voice and the not unpleasant
English accent of a manly young lordling who was
going to America for sport. Uncle Larry and Dear
Jones were enticing each other into a bet on the ship’s
run of the morrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll give you two to one she don’t make 420,” said
Dear Jones.</p>

<p>“I’ll take it,” answered Uncle Larry. “We made
427 the fifth day last year.” It was Uncle Larry’s
seventeenth visit to Europe, and this was therefore his
thirty-fourth voyage.</p>

<p>“And when did you get in?” asked Baby Van
Rensselaer. “I don’t care a bit about the run, so
long as we get in soon.”</p>

<p>“We crossed the bar Sunday night, just seven days
after we left Queenstown, and we dropped anchor off
Quarantine at three o’clock on Monday morning.”</p>

<p>“I hope we sha’n’t do that this time. I can’t seem
to sleep any when the boat stops.”</p>

<p>“I can; but I didn’t,” continued Uncle Larry;
“because my stateroom was the most for’ard in the
boat, and the donkey-engine that let down the anchor
was right over my head.”</p>

<p>“So you got up and saw the sunrise over the bay,”
said Dear Jones, “with the electric lights of the city
twinkling in the distance, and the first faint flush of
the dawn in the east just over Fort Lafayette, and the
rosy tinge which spread softly upward, and”&mdash;</p>

<p>“Did you both come back together?” asked the
Duchess.</p>

<p>“Because he has crossed thirty-four times you must
not suppose he has a monopoly in sunrises,” retorted
Dear Jones. “No; this was my own sunrise; and a
mighty pretty one it was, too.”</p>

<p>“I’m not matching sunrises with you,” remarked
Uncle Larry calmly; “but I’m willing to back a merry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
jest called forth by my sunrise against any two merry
jests called forth by yours.”</p>

<p>“I confess reluctantly that my sunrise evoked no
merry jest at all.” Dear Jones was an honest man,
and would scorn to invent a merry jest on the spur of
the moment.</p>

<p>“That’s where my sunrise has the call,” said Uncle
Larry complacently.</p>

<p>“What was the merry jest?” was Baby Van Rensselaer’s
inquiry, the natural result of a feminine curiosity
thus artistically excited.</p>

<p>“Well, here it is. I was standing aft, near a patriotic
American and a wandering Irishman, and the
patriotic American rashly declared that you couldn’t
see a sunrise like that anywhere in Europe, and this
gave the Irishman his chance, and he said, ‘Sure ye
don’t have ’m here till we’re through with ’em over
there.’”</p>

<p>“It is true,” said Dear Jones thoughtfully, “that
they do have some things over there better than we do;
for instance, umbrellas.”</p>

<p>“And gowns,” added the Duchess.</p>

<p>“And antiquities”&mdash;this was Uncle Larry’s contribution.</p>

<p>“And we do have some things so much better in
America!” protested Baby Van Rensselaer, as yet
uncorrupted by any worship of the effete monarchies
of despotic Europe. “We make lots of things a great
deal nicer than you can get them in Europe&mdash;especially
ice-cream.”</p>

<p>“And pretty girls,” added Dear Jones; but he did
not look at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>“And spooks,” remarked Uncle Larry casually.</p>

<p>“Spooks?” queried the Duchess.</p>

<p>“Spooks. I maintain the word. Ghosts, if you like
that better, or spectres. We turn out the best quality
of spook”&mdash;</p>

<p>“You forget the lovely ghost stories about the Rhine,
and the Black Forest,” interrupted Miss Van Rensselaer,
with feminine inconsistency.</p>

<p>“I remember the Rhine and the Black Forest and
all the other haunts of elves and fairies and hobgoblins;
but for good honest spooks there is no place like home.
And what differentiates our spook&mdash;<i lang="la">spiritus Americanus</i>&mdash;from
the ordinary ghost of literature is that
it responds to the American sense of humor. Take
Irving’s stories, for example. <cite>The Headless Horseman</cite>,
that’s a comic ghost story. And Rip Van
Winkle&mdash;consider what humor, and what good-humor,
there is in the telling of his meeting with the
goblin crew of Hendrik Hudson’s men! A still better
example of this American way of dealing with legend
and mystery is the marvellous tale of the rival ghosts.”</p>

<p>“The rival ghosts?” queried the Duchess and Baby
Van Rensselaer together. “Who were they?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I ever tell you about them?” answered
Uncle Larry, a gleam of approaching joy flashing
from his eye.</p>

<p>“Since he is bound to tell us sooner or later, we’d
better be resigned, and hear it now,” said Dear Jones.</p>

<p>“If you are not more eager, I won’t tell it at all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do, Uncle Larry; you know I just dote on
ghost stories,” pleaded Baby Van Rensselaer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“Once upon a time,” began Uncle Larry&mdash;“in fact,
a very few years ago&mdash;there lived in the thriving
town of New York a young American called Duncan&mdash;Eliphalet
Duncan. Like his name, he was half
Yankee and half Scotch, and naturally he was a lawyer,
and had come to New York to make his way. His
father was a Scotchman, who had come over and
settled in Boston, and married a Salem girl. When
Eliphalet Duncan was about twenty he lost both of his
parents. His father left him with enough money to
give him a start, and a strong feeling of pride in his
Scotch birth; you see there was a title in the family
in Scotland, and although Eliphalet’s father was the
younger son of a younger son, yet he always remembered,
and always bade his only son to remember, that
his ancestry was noble. His mother left him her full
share of Yankee grit, and a little old house in Salem
which had belonged to her family for more than two
hundred years. She was a Hitchcock, and the Hitchcocks
had been settled in Salem since the year 1. It
was a great-great-grandfather of Mr. Eliphalet Hitchcock
who was foremost in the time of the Salem
witchcraft craze. And this little old house which she
left to my friend Eliphalet Duncan was haunted.”</p>

<p>“By the ghost of one of the witches, of course,”
interrupted Dear Jones.</p>

<p>“Now how could it be the ghost of a witch, since
the witches were all burned at the stake? You never
heard of anybody who was burned having a ghost, did
you?”</p>

<p>“That’s an argument in favor of cremation, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
any rate,” replied Jones, evading the direct question.</p>

<p>“It is, if you don’t like ghosts. I do,” said Baby
Van Rensselaer.</p>

<p>“And so do I,” added Uncle Larry. “I love a
ghost as dearly as an Englishman loves a lord.”</p>

<p>“Go on with your story,” said the Duchess, majestically
overruling all extraneous discussion.</p>

<p>“This little old house at Salem was haunted,” resumed
Uncle Larry. “And by a very distinguished
ghost&mdash;or at least by a ghost with very remarkable
attributes.”</p>

<p>“What was he like?” asked Baby Van Rensselaer,
with a premonitory shiver of anticipatory delight.</p>

<p>“It had a lot of peculiarities. In the first place, it
never appeared to the master of the house. Mostly it
confined its visitations to unwelcome guests. In the
course of the last hundred years it had frightened
away four successive mothers-in-law, while never intruding
on the head of the household.”</p>

<p>“I guess that ghost had been one of the boys when
he was alive and in the flesh.” This was Dear Jones’s
contribution to the telling of the tale.</p>

<p>“In the second place,” continued Uncle Larry, “it
never frightened anybody the first time it appeared.
Only on the second visit were the ghost-seers scared;
but then they were scared enough for twice, and they
rarely mustered up courage enough to risk a third
interview. One of the most curious characteristics of
this well-meaning spook was that it had no face&mdash;or
at least that nobody ever saw its face.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>“Perhaps he kept his countenance veiled?” queried
the Duchess, who was beginning to remember that she
never did like ghost stories.</p>

<p>“That was what I was never able to find out. I
have asked several people who saw the ghost, and none
of them could tell me anything about its face, and yet
while in its presence they never noticed its features,
and never remarked on their absence or concealment.
It was only afterward when they tried to recall calmly
all the circumstances of meeting with the mysterious
stranger, that they became aware that they had not
seen its face. And they could not say whether the
features were covered, or whether they were wanting,
or what the trouble was. They knew only that the
face was never seen. And no matter how often they
might see it, they never fathomed this mystery. To
this day nobody knows whether the ghost which used
to haunt the little old house in Salem had a face, or
what manner of face it had.”</p>

<p>“How awfully weird!” said Baby Van Rensselaer.
“And why did the ghost go away?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t said it went away,” answered Uncle
Larry, with much dignity.</p>

<p>“But you said it <em>used</em> to haunt the little old house
at Salem, so I supposed it had moved. Didn’t it?”</p>

<p>“You shall be told in due time. Eliphalet Duncan
used to spend most of his summer vacations at Salem,
and the ghost never bothered him at all, for he was
the master of the house&mdash;much to his disgust, too,
because he wanted to see for himself the mysterious
tenant at will of his property. But he never saw it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
never. He arranged with friends to call him whenever
it might appear, and he slept in the next room
with the door open; and yet when their frightened
cries waked him the ghost was gone, and his only
reward was to hear reproachful sighs as soon as he
went back to bed. You see, the ghost thought it was
not fair of Eliphalet to seek an introduction which was
plainly unwelcome.”</p>

<p>Dear Jones interrupted the story-teller by getting up
and tucking a heavy rug more snugly around Baby Van
Rensselaer’s feet, for the sky was now overcast and
gray, and the air was damp and penetrating.</p>

<p>“One fine spring morning,” pursued Uncle Larry,
“Eliphalet Duncan received great news. I told you
that there was a title in the family in Scotland, and
that Eliphalet’s father was the younger son of a younger
son. Well, it happened that all Eliphalet’s father’s
brothers and uncles had died off without male issue
except the eldest son of the eldest, and he, of course,
bore the title, and was Baron Duncan of Duncan.
Now the great news that Eliphalet Duncan received
in New York one fine spring morning was that Baron
Duncan and his only son had been yachting in the
Hebrides, and they had been caught in a black squall,
and they were both dead. So my friend Eliphalet
Duncan inherited the title and the estates.”</p>

<p>“How romantic!” said the Duchess. “So he was
a baron!”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Uncle Larry, “he was a baron if
he chose. But he didn’t choose.”</p>

<p>“More fool he!” said Dear Jones sententiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” answered Uncle Larry, “I’m not so sure
of that. You see, Eliphalet Duncan was half Scotch
and half Yankee, and he had two eyes to the main
chance. He held his tongue about his windfall of luck
until he could find out whether the Scotch estates were
enough to keep up the Scotch title. He soon discovered
that they were not, and that the late Lord Duncan, having
married money, kept up such state as he could out
of the revenues of the dowry of Lady Duncan. And
Eliphalet, he decided that he would rather be a well-fed
lawyer in New York, living comfortably on his
practice, than a starving lord in Scotland, living scantily
on his title.”</p>

<p>“But he kept his title?” asked the Duchess.</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Uncle Larry, “he kept it quiet.
I knew it, and a friend or two more. But Eliphalet
was a sight too smart to put Baron Duncan of Duncan,
Attorney and Counsellor at Law, on his shingle.”</p>

<p>“What has all this got to do with your ghost?”
asked Dear Jones pertinently.</p>

<p>“Nothing with that ghost, but a good deal with another
ghost. Eliphalet was very learned in spirit lore&mdash;perhaps
because he owned the haunted house at
Salem, perhaps because he was a Scotchman by descent.
At all events, he had made a special study of
the wraiths and white ladies and banshees and bogies
of all kinds whose sayings and doings and warnings are
recorded in the annals of the Scottish nobility. In
fact, he was acquainted with the habits of every reputable
spook in the Scotch peerage. And he knew
that there was a Duncan ghost attached to the person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
of the holder of the title of Baron Duncan of
Duncan.”</p>

<p>“So, besides being the owner of a haunted house in
Salem, he was also a haunted man in Scotland?” asked
Baby Van Rensselaer.</p>

<p>“Just so. But the Scotch ghost was not unpleasant,
like the Salem ghost, although it had one peculiarity in
common with its transatlantic fellow-spook. It never
appeared to the holder of the title, just as the other
never was visible to the owner of the house. In fact,
the Duncan ghost was never seen at all. It was a
guardian angel only. Its sole duty was to be in personal
attendance on Baron Duncan of Duncan, and to
warn him of impending evil. The traditions of the
house told that the Barons of Duncan had again and
again felt a premonition of ill fortune. Some of them
had yielded and withdrawn from the venture they
had undertaken, and it had failed dismally. Some had
been obstinate, and had hardened their hearts, and had
gone on reckless to defeat and to death. In no case
had a Lord Duncan been exposed to peril without fair
warning.”</p>

<p>“Then how came it that the father and son were
lost in the yacht off the Hebrides?” asked Dear
Jones.</p>

<p>“Because they were too enlightened to yield to
superstition. There is extant now a letter of Lord
Duncan, written to his wife a few minutes before he
and his son set sail, in which he tells her how hard he
has had to struggle with an almost overmastering desire
to give up the trip. Had he obeyed the friendly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
warning of the family ghost, the latter would have
been spared a journey across the Atlantic.”</p>

<p>“Did the ghost leave Scotland for America as soon
as the old baron died?” asked Baby Van Rensselaer,
with much interest.</p>

<p>“How did he come over,” queried Dear Jones&mdash;“in
the steerage, or as a cabin passenger?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Uncle Larry calmly,
“and Eliphalet, he didn’t know. For as he was in no
danger, and stood in no need of warning, he couldn’t
tell whether the ghost was on duty or not. Of course
he was on the watch for it all the time. But he never
got any proof of its presence until he went down to the
little old house of Salem, just before the Fourth of
July. He took a friend down with him&mdash;a young
fellow who had been in the regular army since the day
Fort Sumter was fired on, and who thought that after
four years of the little unpleasantness down South, including
six months in Libby, and after ten years of
fighting the bad Indians on the plains, he wasn’t likely
to be much frightened by a ghost. Well, Eliphalet
and the officer sat out on the porch all the evening
smoking and talking over points in military law. A
little after twelve o’clock, just as they began to think
it was about time to turn in, they heard the most
ghastly noise in the house. It wasn’t a shriek, or a
howl, or a yell, or anything they could put a name to.
It was an undeterminate, inexplicable shiver and shudder
of sound, which went wailing out of the window.
The officer had been at Cold Harbor, but he felt himself
getting colder this time. Eliphalet knew it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the ghost who haunted the house. As this weird sound
died away, it was followed by another, sharp, short,
blood-curdling in its intensity. Something in this cry
seemed familiar to Eliphalet, and he felt sure that it
proceeded from the family ghost, the warning wraith
of the Duncans.”</p>

<p>“Do I understand you to intimate that both ghosts
were there together?” inquired the Duchess anxiously.</p>

<p>“Both of them were there,” answered Uncle Larry.
“You see, one of them belonged to the house, and had
to be there all the time, and the other was attached to
the person of Baron Duncan, and had to follow him
there; wherever he was, there was that ghost also.
But Eliphalet, he had scarcely time to think this out
when he heard both sounds again, not one after another,
but both together, and something told him&mdash;some
sort of an instinct he had&mdash;that those two
ghosts didn’t agree, didn’t get on together, didn’t
exactly hit it off; in fact, that they were quarrelling.”</p>

<p>“Quarrelling ghosts! Well, I never!” was Baby
Van Rensselaer’s remark.</p>

<p>“It is a blessed thing to see ghosts dwell together in
unity,” said Dear Jones.</p>

<p>And the Duchess added, “It would certainly be setting
a better example.”</p>

<p>“You know,” resumed Uncle Larry, “that two waves
of light or of sound may interfere and produce darkness
or silence. So it was with these rival spooks. They
interfered, but they did not produce silence or darkness.
On the contrary, as soon as Eliphalet and the
officer went into the house, there began at once a series<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
of spiritualistic manifestations, a regular dark séance.
A tambourine was played upon, a bell was rung, and a
flaming banjo went singing around the room.”</p>

<p>“Where did they get the banjo?” asked Dear Jones
skeptically.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Materialized it, maybe, just as
they did the tambourine. You don’t suppose a quiet
New York lawyer kept a stock of musical instruments
large enough to fit out a strolling minstrel troupe just
on the chance of a pair of ghosts coming to give him a
surprise party, do you? Every spook has its own instrument
of torture. Angels play on harps, I’m informed,
and spirits delight in banjos and tambourines. These
spooks of Eliphalet Duncan’s were ghosts with all the
modern improvements, and I guess they were capable
of providing their own musical weapons. At all
events, they had them there in the little old house at
Salem the night Eliphalet and his friend came down.
And they played on them, and they rang the bell, and
they rapped here, there, and everywhere. And they
kept it up all night.”</p>

<p>“All night?” asked the awe-stricken Duchess.</p>

<p>“All night long,” said Uncle Larry solemnly; “and
the next night, too. Eliphalet did not get a wink of
sleep, neither did his friend. On the second night the
house ghost was seen by the officer; on the third night
it showed itself again; and the next morning the
officer packed his grip-sack and took the first train to
Boston. He was a New Yorker, but he said he’d
sooner go to Boston than see that ghost again. Eliphalet,
he wasn’t scared at all, partly because he never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
saw either the domiciliary or the titular spook, and
partly because he felt himself on friendly terms with
the spirit world, and didn’t scare easily. But after
losing three nights’ sleep and the society of his friend,
he began to be a little impatient, and to think that the
thing had gone far enough. You see, while in a way
he was fond of ghosts, yet he liked them best one at
a time. Two ghosts were one too many. He wasn’t
bent on making a collection of spooks. He and one
ghost were company, but he and two ghosts were a
crowd.”</p>

<p>“What did he do?” asked Baby Van Rensselaer.</p>

<p>“Well, he couldn’t do anything. He waited awhile,
hoping they would get tired; but he got tired out
first. You see, it comes natural to a spook to sleep in
the daytime, but a man wants to sleep nights, and they
wouldn’t let him sleep nights. They kept on wrangling
and quarrelling incessantly; they manifested and
they dark-séanced as regularly as the old clock on the
stairs struck twelve; they rapped and they rang bells
and they banged the tambourine and they threw the
flaming banjo about the house, and, worse than all,
they swore.”</p>

<p>“I did not know that spirits were addicted to bad
language,” said the Duchess.</p>

<p>“How did he know they were swearing? Could he
hear them?” asked Dear Jones.</p>

<p>“That was just it,” responded Uncle Larry; “he
could not hear them&mdash;at least not distinctly. There
were inarticulate murmurs and stifled rumblings. But
the impression produced on him was that they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
swearing. If they had only sworn right out, he would
not have minded it so much, because he would have
known the worst. But the feeling that the air was full
of suppressed profanity was very wearing, and after
standing it for a week, he gave up in disgust and went
to the White Mountains.”</p>

<p>“Leaving them to fight it out, I suppose,” interjected
Baby Van Rensselaer.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” explained Uncle Larry. “They could
not quarrel unless he was present. You see, he could
not leave the titular ghost behind him, and the domiciliary
ghost could not leave the house. When he went
away he took the family ghost with him, leaving the
house ghost behind. Now spooks can’t quarrel when
they are a hundred miles apart any more than men
can.”</p>

<p>“And what happened afterward?” asked Baby Van
Rensselaer, with a pretty impatience.</p>

<p>“A most marvellous thing happened. Eliphalet
Duncan went to the White Mountains, and in the car
of the railroad that runs to the top of Mount Washington
he met a classmate whom he had not seen for
years, and this classmate introduced Duncan to his sister,
and this sister was a remarkably pretty girl, and
Duncan fell in love with her at first sight, and by the
time he got to the top of Mount Washington he was
so deep in love that he began to consider his own unworthiness,
and to wonder whether she might ever be
induced to care for him a little&mdash;ever so little.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that is so marvellous a thing,” said
Dear Jones, glancing at Baby Van Rensselaer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who was she?” asked the Duchess, who had once
lived in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>“She was Miss Kitty Sutton, of San Francisco, and
she was a daughter of old Judge Sutton, of the firm of
Pixley and Sutton.”</p>

<p>“A very respectable family,” assented the Duchess.</p>

<p>“I hope she wasn’t a daughter of that loud and
vulgar old Mrs. Sutton whom I met at Saratoga, one
summer, four or five years ago?” said Dear Jones.</p>

<p>“Probably she was.”</p>

<p>“She was a horrid old woman. The boys used to
call her Mother Gorgon.”</p>

<p>“The pretty Kitty Sutton with whom Eliphalet
Duncan had fallen in love was the daughter of Mother
Gorgon. But he never saw the mother, who was in
’Frisco, or Los Angeles, or Santa Fé, or somewhere out
West, and he saw a great deal of the daughter, who
was up in the White Mountains. She was travelling
with her brother and his wife, and as they journeyed
from hotel to hotel, Duncan went with them, and filled
out the quartette. Before the end of the summer he
began to think about proposing. Of course he had
lots of chances, going on excursions as they were
every day. He made up his mind to seize the first
opportunity, and that very evening he took her out
for a moonlight row on Lake Winnipiseogee. As he
handed her into the boat he resolved to do it, and he
had a glimmer of a suspicion that she knew he was
going to do it, too.”</p>

<p>“Girls,” said Dear Jones, “never go out in a row-boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
at night with a young man unless you mean to
accept him.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes it’s best to refuse him, and get it over
once for all,” said Baby Van Rensselaer.</p>

<p>“As Eliphalet took the oars he felt a sudden chill.
He tried to shake it off, but in vain. He began to
have a growing consciousness of impending evil. Before
he had taken ten strokes&mdash;and he was a swift
oarsman&mdash;he was aware of a mysterious presence between
him and Miss Sutton.”</p>

<p>“Was it the guardian-angel ghost warning him off
the match?” interrupted Dear Jones.</p>

<p>“That’s just what it was,” said Uncle Larry. “And
he yielded to it, and kept his peace, and rowed Miss
Sutton back to the hotel with his proposal unspoken.”</p>

<p>“More fool he,” said Dear Jones. “It will take
more than one ghost to keep me from proposing when
my mind is made up.” And he looked at Baby Van
Rensselaer.</p>

<p>“The next morning,” continued Uncle Larry,
“Eliphalet overslept himself, and when he went down
to a late breakfast he found that the Suttons had gone
to New York by the morning train. He wanted to
follow them at once, and again he felt the mysterious
presence overpowering his will. He struggled two
days, and at last he roused himself to do what he
wanted in spite of the spook. When he arrived in
New York it was late in the evening. He dressed
himself hastily, and went to the hotel where the Suttons
put up, in the hope of seeing at least her brother.
The guardian angel fought every inch of the walk with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
him, until he began to wonder whether, if Miss Sutton
were to take him, the spook would forbid the banns.
At the hotel he saw no one that night, and he went
home determined to call as early as he could the next
afternoon, and make an end of it. When he left his
office about two o’clock the next day to learn his fate,
he had not walked five blocks before he discovered
that the wraith of the Duncans had withdrawn his opposition
to the suit. There was no feeling of impending
evil, no resistance, no struggle, no consciousness of
an opposing presence. Eliphalet was greatly encouraged.
He walked briskly to the hotel; he found Miss
Sutton alone. He asked her the question, and got his
answer.”</p>

<p>“She accepted him, of course,” said Baby Van Rensselaer.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Uncle Larry. “And while they
were in the first flush of joy, swapping confidences and
confessions, her brother came into the parlor with an
expression of pain on his face and a telegram in his
hand. The former was caused by the latter, which
was from ’Frisco, and which announced the sudden
death of Mrs. Sutton, their mother.”</p>

<p>“And that was why the ghost no longer opposed
the match?” questioned Dear Jones.</p>

<p>“Exactly. You see, the family ghost knew that
Mother Gorgon was an awful obstacle to Duncan’s
happiness, so it warned him. But the moment the
obstacle was removed, it gave its consent at once.”</p>

<p>The fog was lowering its thick damp curtain, and it
was beginning to be difficult to see from one end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
boat to the other. Dear Jones tightened the rug which
enwrapped Baby Van Rensselaer, and then withdrew
again into his own substantial coverings.</p>

<p>Uncle Larry paused in his story long enough to light
another of the tiny cigars he always smoked.</p>

<p>“I infer that Lord Duncan”&mdash;the Duchess was
scrupulous in the bestowal of titles&mdash;“saw no more of
the ghosts after he was married.”</p>

<p>“He never saw them at all, at any time, either before
or since. But they came very near breaking off
the match, and thus breaking two young hearts.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say that they knew any just
cause or impediment why they should not forever after
hold their peace?” asked Dear Jones.</p>

<p>“How could a ghost, or even two ghosts, keep a girl
from marrying the man she loved?” This was Baby
Van Rensselaer’s question.</p>

<p>“It seems curious, doesn’t it?” and Uncle Larry
tried to warm himself by two or three sharp pulls at
his fiery little cigar. “And the circumstances are
quite as curious as the fact itself. You see, Miss Sutton
wouldn’t be married for a year after her mother’s
death, so she and Duncan had lots of time to tell each
other all they knew. Eliphalet, he got to know a good
deal about the girls she went to school with, and Kitty,
she learned all about his family. He didn’t tell her
about the title for a long time, as he wasn’t one to
brag. But he described to her the little old house at
Salem. And one evening toward the end of the summer,
the wedding-day having been appointed for early
in September, she told him that she didn’t want a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
bridal tour at all; she just wanted to go down to the
little old house at Salem to spend her honeymoon in
peace and quiet, with nothing to do and nobody to
bother them. Well, Eliphalet jumped at the suggestion:
it suited him down to the ground. All of a sudden
he remembered the spooks, and it knocked him all
of a heap. He had told her about the Duncan banshee,
and the idea of having an ancestral ghost in personal
attendance on her husband tickled her immensely.
But he had never said anything about the ghost which
haunted the little old house at Salem. He knew she
would be frightened out of her wits if the house ghost
revealed itself to her, and he saw at once that it would
be impossible to go to Salem on their wedding trip.
So he told her all about it, and how whenever he went
to Salem the two ghosts interfered, and gave dark
séances and manifested and materialized and made the
place absolutely impossible. Kitty, she listened in
silence, and Eliphalet, he thought she had changed her
mind. But she hadn’t done anything of the kind.”</p>

<p>“Just like a man&mdash;to think she was going to,” remarked
Baby Van Rensselaer.</p>

<p>“She just told him she could not bear ghosts herself,
but she would not marry a man who was afraid of
them.”</p>

<p>“Just like a girl&mdash;to be so inconsistent,” remarked
Dear Jones.</p>

<p>Uncle Larry’s tiny cigar had long been extinct. He
lighted a new one, and continued: “Eliphalet protested
in vain. Kitty said her mind was made up.
She was determined to pass her honeymoon in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
little old house at Salem, and she was equally determined
not to go there as long as there were any ghosts
there. Until he could assure her that the spectral tenant
had received notice to quit, and that there was no
danger of manifestations and materializing, she refused
to be married at all. She did not intend to have her
honeymoon interrupted by two wrangling ghosts, and
the wedding could be postponed until he had made
ready the house for her.”</p>

<p>“She was an unreasonable young woman,” said the
Duchess.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s what Eliphalet thought, much as he
was in love with her. And he believed he could talk
her out of her determination. But he couldn’t. She
was set. And when a girl is set, there’s nothing to do
but to yield to the inevitable. And that’s just what
Eliphalet did. He saw he would either have to give
her up or to get the ghosts out; and as he loved her
and did not care for the ghosts, he resolved to tackle
the ghosts. He had clear grit, Eliphalet had&mdash;he was
half Scotch and half Yankee, and neither breed turns
tail in a hurry. So he made his plans and he went
down to Salem. As he said good-by to Kitty he had
an impression that she was sorry she had made him go,
but she kept up bravely, and put a bold face on it, and
saw him off, and went home and cried for an hour, and
was perfectly miserable until he came back the next
day.”</p>

<p>“Did he succeed in driving the ghosts away?”
asked Baby Van Rensselaer, with great interest.</p>

<p>“That’s just what I’m coming to,” said Uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Larry, pausing at the critical moment, in the manner
of the trained story-teller. “You see, Eliphalet had
got a rather tough job, and he would gladly have had
an extension of time on the contract, but he had to
choose between the girl and the ghosts, and he wanted
the girl. He tried to invent or remember some short
and easy way with ghosts, but he couldn’t. He wished
that somebody had invented a specific for spooks&mdash;something
that would make the ghosts come out of the
house and die in the yard. He wondered if he could
not tempt the ghosts to run in debt, so that he might
get the sheriff to help him. He wondered also whether
the ghosts could not be overcome with strong drink&mdash;a
dissipated spook, a spook with delirium tremens,
might be committed to the inebriate asylum. But
none of these things seemed feasible.”</p>

<p>“What did he do?” interrupted Dear Jones. “The
learned counsel will please speak to the point.”</p>

<p>“You will regret this unseemly haste,” said Uncle
Larry, gravely, “when you know what really happened.”</p>

<p>“What was it, Uncle Larry?” asked Baby Van
Rensselaer. “I’m all impatience.”</p>

<p>And Uncle Larry proceeded:</p>

<p>“Eliphalet went down to the little old house at
Salem, and as soon as the clock struck twelve the rival
ghosts began wrangling as before. Raps here, there,
and everywhere, ringing bells, banging tambourines,
strumming banjos sailing about the room, and all the
other manifestations and materializations followed one
another just as they had the summer before. The only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
difference Eliphalet could detect was a stronger flavor
in the spectral profanity; and this, of course, was only a
vague impression, for he did not actually hear a single
word. He waited awhile in patience, listening and
watching. Of course he never saw either of the ghosts,
because neither of them could appear to him. At last
he got his dander up, and he thought it was about time
to interfere, so he rapped on the table, and asked for
silence. As soon as he felt that the spooks were listening
to him he explained the situation to them. He
told them he was in love, and that he could not marry
unless they vacated the house. He appealed to them
as old friends, and he laid claim to their gratitude. The
titular ghost had been sheltered by the Duncan family
for hundreds of years, and the domiciliary ghost had
had free lodging in the little old house at Salem for
nearly two centuries. He implored them to settle their
differences, and to get him out of his difficulty at once.
He suggested that they had better fight it out then and
there, and see who was master. He had brought down
with him all needful weapons. And he pulled out his
valise, and spread on the table a pair of navy revolvers,
a pair of shot-guns, a pair of duelling swords, and a
couple of bowie-knives. He offered to serve as second
for both parties, and to give the word when to begin.
He also took out of his valise a pack of cards and a
bottle of poison, telling them that if they wished to
avoid carnage they might cut the cards to see which
one should take the poison. Then he waited anxiously
for their reply. For a little space there was silence.
Then he became conscious of a tremulous shivering in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
one corner of the room, and he remembered that he
had heard from that direction what sounded like a
frightened sigh when he made the first suggestion of
the duel. Something told him that this was the domiciliary
ghost, and that it was badly scared. Then he
was impressed by a certain movement in the opposite
corner of the room, as though the titular ghost were
drawing himself up with offended dignity. Eliphalet
couldn’t exactly see these things, because he never saw
the ghosts, but he felt them. After a silence of nearly
a minute a voice came from the corner where the
family ghost stood&mdash;a voice strong and full, but trembling
slightly with suppressed passion. And this voice
told Eliphalet it was plain enough that he had not long
been the head of the Duncans, and that he had never
properly considered the characteristics of his race if
now he supposed that one of his blood could draw his
sword against a woman. Eliphalet said he had never
suggested that the Duncan ghost should raise his hand
against a woman, and all he wanted was that the Duncan
ghost should fight the other ghost. And then the
voice told Eliphalet that the other ghost was a woman.”</p>

<p>“What?” said Dear Jones, sitting up suddenly.
“You don’t mean to tell me that the ghost which
haunted the house was a woman?”</p>

<p>“Those were the very words Eliphalet Duncan
used,” said Uncle Larry; “but he did not need to
wait for the answer. All at once he recalled the traditions
about the domiciliary ghost, and he knew that
what the titular ghost said was the fact. He had never
thought of the sex of a spook, but there was no doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
whatever that the house ghost was a woman. No
sooner was this firmly fixed in Eliphalet’s mind than
he saw his way out of the difficulty. The ghosts must
be married!&mdash;for then there would be no more interference,
no more quarrelling, no more manifestations
and materializations, no more dark séances, with their
raps and bells and tambourines and banjos. At first
the ghosts would not hear of it. The voice in the corner
declared that the Duncan wraith had never thought
of matrimony. But Eliphalet argued with them, and
pleaded and persuaded and coaxed, and dwelt on the
advantages of matrimony. He had to confess, of
course, that he did not know how to get a clergyman
to marry them; but the voice from the corner gravely
told him that there need be no difficulty in regard to
that, as there was no lack of spiritual chaplains. Then,
for the first time, the house ghost spoke, in a low, clear,
gentle voice, and with a quaint, old-fashioned New
England accent, which contrasted sharply with the
broad Scotch speech of the family ghost. She said
that Eliphalet Duncan seemed to have forgotten that
she was married. But this did not upset Eliphalet at
all; he remembered the whole case clearly, and he told
her she was not a married ghost, but a widow, since
her husband had been hung for murdering her. Then
the Duncan ghost drew attention to the great disparity
in their ages, saying that he was nearly four hundred
and fifty years old, while she was barely two hundred.
But Eliphalet had not talked to juries for nothing; he
just buckled to, and coaxed those ghosts into matrimony.
Afterward he came to the conclusion that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
were willing to be coaxed, but at the time he thought
he had pretty hard work to convince them of the
advantages of the plan.”</p>

<p>“Did he succeed?” asked Baby Van Rensselaer, with
a young lady’s interest in matrimony.</p>

<p>“He did,” said Uncle Larry. “He talked the wraith
of the Duncans and the spectre of the little old house
at Salem into a matrimonial engagement. And from
the time they were engaged he had no more trouble
with them. They were rival ghosts no longer. They
were married by their spiritual chaplain the very same
day that Eliphalet Duncan met Kitty Sutton in front
of the railing of Grace Church. The ghostly bride and
bridegroom went away at once on their bridal tour, and
Lord and Lady Duncan went down to the little old
house at Salem to pass their honeymoon.”</p>

<p>Uncle Larry stopped. His tiny cigar was out again.
The tale of the rival ghosts was told. A solemn silence
fell on the little party on the deck of the ocean steamer,
broken harshly by the hoarse roar of the fog-horn.</p>

<h2 id="A_LETTER_AND_A_PARAGRAPH">A LETTER AND A PARAGRAPH.</h2>

<p class="author">BY H. C. BUNNER.</p>

<h3>I.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE LETTER.</span></h3>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">New York</span>, Nov. 16, 1883.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My dear Will</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>You cannot be expected to remember it, but this
is the fifth anniversary of my wedding-day, and to-morrow&mdash;it
will be to-morrow before this letter is
closed&mdash;is my birthday&mdash;my fortieth. My head is
full of those thoughts which the habit of my life moves
me to put on paper, where I can best express them;
and yet which must be written for only the friendliest
of eyes. It is not the least of my happiness in this life
that I have one friend to whom I can unlock my heart
as I can to you.</p>

<p>The wife has just been putting your namesake to
sleep. Don’t infer that, even on the occasion of this
family feast, he has been allowed to sit up until half past
eleven. He went to bed properly enough, with a tear
or two, at eight; but when his mother stole into his
room just now, after her custom, I heard his small
voice raised in drowsy inquiry; and I followed her,
and slipped the curtain of the doorway aside, and
looked. But I did not go into the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>The shaded lamp was making a yellow glory in one
spot&mdash;the head of the little brass crib where my wife
knelt by my boy. I saw the little face, so like hers,
turned up to her. There was a smile on it that I knew
was a reflection of hers. He was winking in a merry
half-attempt to keep awake; but wakefulness was
slipping away from him under the charm of that smile
that I could not see. His brown eyes closed, and
opened for an instant, and closed again as the tender,
happy hush of a child’s sleep settled down upon him,
and he was gone where we in our heavier slumbers shall
hardly follow him. Then, before I could see my wife’s
face as she bent and kissed him, I let the curtain fall,
and crept back here, to sit by the last of the fire, and
see that sacred sight again with the spiritual eyes, and
to dream wonderingly over the unspeakable happiness
that has in some mysterious way come to me, undeserving.</p>

<p>I tell you, Will, that moment was to me like one of
those moments of waking that we know in childhood,
when we catch the going of a dream too subtly sweet
to belong to this earth&mdash;a glad vision, gone before our
eyes can open wide; not to be figured into any earthly
idea, leaving in its passage a joy so high and fine that
the poets tell us it is a memory of some heaven from
which our young souls are yet fresh.</p>

<p>You can understand how it is that I find it hard to
realize that there can be such things in my life; for
you know what that life was up to a few years ago.
I am like a man who has spent his first thirty years in
a cave. It takes more than a decade above ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
to make him quite believe in the sun and the blue of
the sky.</p>

<p>I was sitting just now before the hearth, with my
feet in the bearskin rug you sent us two Christmases
ago. The light of the low wood fire was chasing the
shadows around the room, over my books and my
pictures, and all the fine and gracious luxuries with
which I may now make my eyes and my heart glad,
and pamper the tastes that grow with feeding. I was
taking count, so to speak, of my prosperity&mdash;the
material treasures, the better treasure that I find in
such portion of fame as the world has allotted me, and
the treasure of treasures across the threshold of the
next room&mdash;in the next room? No&mdash;there, here, in
every room, in every corner of the house, filling it with
peace, is the gentle and holy spirit of love.</p>

<p>As I sat and thought, my mind went back to the day
that you and I first met, twenty-two years ago&mdash;twenty-two
in February next. In twenty-two years
more I could not forget that hideous first day in the
city room of the <cite>Morning Record</cite>. I can see the great
gloomy room, with its meagre gas-jets lighting up, here
and there, a pale face at a desk, and bringing out in
ghastly spots the ugliness of the ink-smeared walls.
A winter rain was pouring down outside. I could feel
its chill and damp in the room, though little of it was
to be seen through the grimy window-panes. The
composing-room in the rear sent a smell of ink and
benzine to permeate the moist atmosphere. The
rumble and shiver of the great presses printing the
weekly came up from below. I sat there in my wet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
clothes and waited for my first assignment. I was
eighteen, poor as a church mouse, green, desperately
hopeful after a boy’s fashion, and with nothing in my
head but the Latin and Greek of my one single year at
college. My spirit had sunk down far out of sight.
My heart beat nervously at every sound of that awful
city editor’s voice, as he called up his soldiers one by
one and assigned them to duty. I could only silently
pray that he would “give me an easy one,” and that I
should not disgrace myself in the doing of it. By Jove,
Will, what an old martinet Baldwin was, for all his
good heart! Do you remember that sharp, crackling
voice of his, and the awful “Be brief! be brief!” that
always drove all capacity for condensation out of a
man’s head, and set him to stammering out his story
with wordy incoherence? Baldwin is on the <cite>Record</cite>
still. I wonder what poor devil is trembling at this
hour under that disconcerting adjuration.</p>

<p>A wretched day that was! The hours went slow as
grief. Smeary little bare-armed fiends trotted in from
the composing-room and out again, bearing fluttering
galley-proofs. Bedraggled, hollow-eyed men came in
from the streets and set their soaked umbrellas to
steam against the heater, and passed into the lion’s den
to feed him with news, and were sent out again to take
up their half-cooked umbrellas and go forth to forage
for more. Everyone, I thought, gave me one brief
glance of contempt and curiosity, and put me out of
his thoughts. Everyone had some business&mdash;everyone
but me. The men who had been waiting with me
were called up one by one and detailed to work. I was
left alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Then a new horror came to torture my nervously
active imagination. Had my superior officer forgotten
his new recruit? Or could he find no task mean
enough for my powers? This filled me at first with
a sinking shame, and then with a hot rage and sense
of wrong. Why should he thus slight me? Had I
not a right to be tried, at least? Was there any duty
he could find that I would not perform or die? I
would go to him and tell him that I had come there
to work; and would make him give me the work. No,
I should simply be snubbed, and sent to my seat like
a school-boy, or perhaps discharged on the spot. I
must bear my humiliation in silence.</p>

<p>I looked up and saw you entering, with your bright,
ruddy boy’s face shining with wet, beaming a greeting
to all the room. In my soul I cursed you, at a
venture, for your lightheartedness and your look of
cheery self-confidence. What a vast stretch of struggle
and success set you above me&mdash;you, the reporter,
above me, the novice! And just then came the awful
summons&mdash;“Barclay! Barclay!”&mdash;I shall hear that
strident note at the judgment day. I went in and
got my orders, and came out with them, all in a sort of
daze that must have made Baldwin think me an idiot.
And then you came up to me and scraped acquaintance
in a desultory way, to hide your kind intent; and
gave me a hint or two as to how to obtain a full
account of the biennial meeting of the Post-Pliocene
Mineralogical Society, or whatever it was, without diving
too deeply into the Post-Pliocene period. I would
have fought for you to the death, at that moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>’Twas a small matter, but the friendship begun in
manly and helpful kindness has gone on for twenty-two
years in mutual faith and loyalty; and the growth
dignifies the seed.</p>

<p>A sturdy growth it was in its sapling days. It was
in the late spring that we decided to take the room
together in St. Mark’s Place. A big room and a poor
room, indeed, on the third story of that “battered
caravanserai,” and for twelve long years it held us
and our hopes and our despairs and our troubles and
our joys.</p>

<p>I don’t think I have forgotten one detail of that room.
There is the generous old fireplace, insultingly bricked
up by modern poverty, all save the meagre niche that
holds our fire&mdash;when we can have a fire. There is the
great second-hand table&mdash;our first purchase&mdash;where
we sit and work for immortality in the scant intervals
of working for life. Your drawer, with the manuscript
of your “Concordance of Political Economy,” is to the
right. Mine is to the left; it holds the unfinished play,
and the poems that might better have been unfinished.
There are the two narrow cots&mdash;yours to the left of
the door as you enter; mine to the right.</p>

<p>How strange that I can see it all so clearly, now that
all is different!</p>

<p>Yet I can remember myself coming home at one
o’clock at night, dragging my tired feet up those dark,
still, tortuous stairs, gripping the shaky baluster for
aid. I open the door&mdash;I can feel the little old-fashioned
brass knob in my palm even now&mdash;and I look to
the left. Ah, you are already at home and in bed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
I need not look toward the table. There is money&mdash;a
little&mdash;in the common treasury; and, in accordance
with our regular compact, I know there stand on that
table twin bottles of beer, half a loaf of rye bread, and
a double palm’s-breadth of Swiss cheese. You are
staying your hunger in sleep; for one may not eat until
the other comes. I will wake you up, and we shall
feast together and talk over the day that is dead and
the day that is begun.</p>

<p>Strange, is it not, that I should have some trouble
to realize that this is only a memory,&mdash;I, with my feet
in the bearskin rug that it would have beggared the
two of us, or a dozen like us, to purchase in those days.
Strange that my mind should be wandering on the
crude work of my boyhood and my early manhood.
I who have won name and fame, as the world would
say. I, to whom young men come for advice and encouragement,
as to a tried veteran! Strange that I
should be thinking of a time when even your true and
tireless friendship could not quench a subtle hunger at
my heart, a hunger for a more dear and intimate
comradeship. I, with the tenderest of wives scarce
out of my sight; even in her sleep she is no further
from me than my own soul.</p>

<p>Strangest of all this, that the mad agony of grief,
the passion of desolation that came upon me when our
long partnership was dissolved for ever, should now be
nothing but a memory, like other memories, to be
summoned up out of the resting-places of the mind,
toyed with, idly questioned, and dismissed with a sigh
and a smile! What a real thing it was just ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
years ago; what a very present pain! Believe me,
Will,&mdash;yes, I want you to believe this&mdash;that in those
first hours of loneliness I could have welcomed death;
death would have fallen upon me as calmly as sleep
has fallen upon my boy in the room beyond there.</p>

<p>You knew nothing of this then; I suppose you but
half believe it now; for our parting was manly enough.
I kept as stiff an upper lip as you did, for all there was
less hair on it. Perhaps it seems extravagant to you.
But there was a deal of difference between our cases.
You had turned your pen to money-making, at the call
of love; you were going to Stillwater to marry the
judge’s daughter, and to become a great land-owner
and mayor of Stillwater and millionaire&mdash;or what is it
now? And much of this you foresaw or hoped for, at
least. Hope is something. But for me? I was left
in the third-story of a poor lodging-house in St. Mark’s
Place, my best friend gone from me; with neither
remembrance nor hope of Love to live on, and with my
last story back from <em>all</em> the magazines.</p>

<p>We will not talk about it. Let me get back to my
pleasant library with the books and the pictures and
the glancing fire-light, and me with my feet in your
bearskin rug, listening to my wife’s step in the next
room.</p>

<p>To your ear, for our communion has been so long
and so close that to either one of us the faintest inflection
of the other’s voice speaks clearer than formulated
words; to your ear there must be something akin to a
tone of regret&mdash;regret for the old days&mdash;in what I have
just said. And would it be strange if there were? A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
poor soldier of fortune who had been set to a man’s work
before he had done with his meagre boyhood, who had
passed from recruit to the place of a young veteran in
that great, hard-fighting, unresting pioneer army of
journalism; was he the man, all of a sudden, to stretch
his toughened sinews out and let them relax in the
glow of the home hearth? Would not his legs begin
to twitch for the road; would he not be wild to feel
again the rain in his weather-beaten face? Would you
think it strange if at night he should toss in his white,
soft bed, longing to change it for a blanket on the turf,
with the broad procession of sunlit worlds sweeping
over his head, beyond the blue spaces of the night?
And even if the dear face on the pillow next him were
to wake and look at him with reproachful surprise;
and even if warm arms drew him back to his new
allegiance; would not his heart in dreams go throbbing
to the rhythm of the drum or the music of songs sung
by the camp-fire?</p>

<p>It was so at the beginning, in the incredible happiness
of the first year, and even after the boy’s birth. Do
you know, it was months before I could accept that
boy as a <em>fact</em>? If, at any moment, he had vanished
from my sight, crib and all, I should not have been
surprised. I was not sure of him until he began to
show his mother’s eyes.</p>

<p>Yes, even in those days some of the old leaven
worked in me. I had moments of that old barbaric
freedom which we used to rejoice in&mdash;that feeling of
being answerable to nothing in the world save my own
will&mdash;the sense of untrammeled, careless power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>Do you remember the night that we walked till sunrise?
You remember how hot it was at midnight,
when we left the office, and how the moonlight on the
statue above the City Hall seemed to invite us fieldward,
where no gaslight glared, no torches flickered.
So we walked idly northward, through the black,
silence-stricken down-town streets; through that feverish,
unresting central region that lies between the vileness
of Houston Street and the calm and spacious
dignity of the brown-stone ways, where the closed and
darkened dwellings looked like huge tombs in the pallid
light of the moon. We passed the suburban belt of
shanties; we passed the garden-girt villas beyond them,
and it was from the hill above Spuyten Duyvil that we
saw the first color of the morning upon the face of the
Palisades.</p>

<p>It would have taken very little in that moment to set
us off to tramping the broad earth, for the pure joy
of free wayfaring. What was there to hold us back?
No tie of home or kin. All we had in the world to
leave behind us was some futile scribbling on various
sheets of paper. And of that sort of thing both our
heads were full enough. I think it was but the veriest
chance that, having begun that walk, we did not go on
and get our fill of wandering, and ruin our lives.</p>

<p>Well, that same wild, adventurous spirit came upon
me now and then. There were times when, for the
moment, I forgot that I had a wife and a child. There
were times when I remembered them as a burden.
Why should I not say this? It is the history of every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
married man,&mdash;at least of every manly man,&mdash;though
he be married to the best woman in the world. It means
no lack of love. It is as unavoidable as the leap of the
blood in you that answers a trumpet-call.</p>

<p>At first I was frightened, and fought against it as
against something that might grow upon me. I reproached
myself for disloyalty in thought. Ah! what
need had <em>I</em> to fight? What need had I to choke down
rebellious fancies, while my wife’s love was working
that miracle that makes two spirits one.</p>

<p>What is it, this union that comes to us as a surprise,
and remains for all outside an incommunicable mystery?
What is this that makes our unmarried love seem so
slight and childish a thing? You and I, who know it,
know that it is no mere fruit of intimacy and usage,
although in its growth it keeps pace with these. We
know that in some subtle way it has been given to a
man to see a woman’s soul as he sees his own, and to a
woman to look into a man’s heart as if it were, indeed,
hers. But the friend who sits at my table, seeing that
my wife and I understand each other at a simple meeting
of the eyes, makes no more of it than he does of the
glance of intelligence which, with close friends, often
takes the place of speech. He never dreams of the
sweet delight with which we commune together in a
language that he cannot understand&mdash;that he cannot
hear&mdash;a language that has no formulated words, feeling
answering feeling.</p>

<p>It is not wonderful that I should wish to give expression
to the gratitude with which I have seen my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
life made to blossom thus; my thankfulness for the
love which has made me not only a happier, but, I
humbly believe, a wiser and a better-minded man.
But I know too well the hopelessness of trying to find
words to describe what, were I a poet, my best song
might but faintly, faintly echo.</p>

<p>I thought I heard a rustle behind me just now. In
a little while my wife will come softly into the room,
and softly up to where I am sitting, stepping silently
across your bearskin rug, and will lay one hand softly
on my left shoulder, while the other slips down this
arm with which I write, until it falls and closes lightly,
yet with loving firmness, on my hand that holds the
pen. And I shall say, “Only the last words to Will
and his wife, dear.” And she will release my hand,
and will lift her own, I think, to caress the patch of
gray hair on my temple; it is a way she has, as though
it were some pitiful scar, and she will say, “Give them
my love, and tell them they must not fail us this
Christmas. I want them to see how our Willy has
grown.” And when she says “Our Willy,” the hand
on my shoulder will instinctively close a little, clingingly;
and she will bend her head, and put her face
close to mine, and I shall turn to look into her eyes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Bear with me, my dear Will, until I have told you
why I have written this letter and what it means. I
have concealed one thing from you for the last six
months. I have disease of the heart, and the doctor
has told me that I may die at any moment. Somehow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
I think&mdash;I know the moment is close at hand; I shall
soon go to that narrow cot on the right of the door,
and I do not believe I shall wake up in the morning
with the sun in my eyes, to look across the room and
see that its companion is gone.</p>

<p>For I am in the old room, Will, as you know, and it
is not ten years since you went away, but two days.
The picture that has seemed real to me as I wrote these
pages is fading, and the thin gas-jet flickers and sinks
as it always did in these first morning hours. I can
hear the roar of the last Harlem train swell and sink,
and the sharp clink of car-bells break the silence that
follows. The wind is gasping and struggling in the
chimney, and blowing a white powdery ash down on
the hearth. I have just burnt my poems and the play.
Both the table drawers are empty now; and soon
enough the two empty chairs will stare at each other
across the bare table. What a wild dream have I
dreamt in all this emptiness! Just now, I thought
indeed that it was true. I thought I heard a woman’s
step behind me, and I turned&mdash;</p>

<p>Peace be with you, Will, in the fullness of your
love. I am going to sleep. Perhaps I shall dream
it all again, and shall hear that soft footfall when the
turn of the night comes, and the pale light through
the ragged blind, and the end of a long loneliness.</p>

<p>After I am dead, I wish you to think of me not as I
was, but as I wanted to be. I have tried to show you
that I have led by your side a happier and dearer life
of hope and aspiration than the one you saw. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
tried to leave your memory a picture of me that you will
not shrink from calling up when you have a quiet hour
and time for thought of the friend whom you knew
well; but whom you may, perhaps, know better now
that he is dead.</p>

<h3>II.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE PARAGRAPH.</span></h3>

<p class="center">[From the <cite>New York Herald</cite> of Nov. 18, 1883.]</p>

<p>Reginald Barclay, a journalist, was found dead in his
bed at 15 St. Mark’s Place, yesterday morning. No
inquest was held, as Mr. Barclay had been known to be
suffering from disease of the heart, and his death was
not unexpected. The deceased came originally from
Oneida County, and was regarded as a young journalist
of considerable promise. He had been for some
years on the city staff of the <cite>Record</cite>, and was the
correspondent of several out-of-town papers. He had
also contributed to the monthly magazines, occasional
poems and short stories, which showed the possession,
in some measure, of the imaginative faculty. Mr. Barclay
was about thirty years of age, and unmarried.</p>

A COMEDY FOR AMATEUR ACTING.</h2>

<p class="author">BY BRANDER MATTHEWS.</p>

<p class="hanging smaller"><i>The Scene is a handsomely-furnished parlor, with a general air of
home comfort. A curtained window on each side of the central
fireplace would light the room if it were not evening, as the lamp
on the work-table in the centre of the room informs us. At one
side of the work-table is the wife, winding a ball of worsted from
a skein which her husband holds in his hands.</i></p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>looking at watch, aside</i>). This wool takes as
long to wind up as a bankrupt estate. (<i>Fidgets.</i>)</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Do keep still, Jack! Stop fidgeting and
jumping around.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> When you pull the string, Jenny, I am always
a jumping-jack to dance attendance on you.</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>seriously</i>). Very pretty, indeed! It was true
too&mdash;once&mdash;before we were married: now you lead
me a different dance.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> I am your partner still.</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>sadly</i>). But the figure is always the Ladies’
Chain.</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>aside</i>). If I don’t get away soon I sha’n’t be
able to do any work to-night.&mdash;(<i>Aloud</i>). What do
you mean by that solemn tone?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Oh, nothing&mdash;nothing of any consequence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>aside</i>). We look like two fools acting in private
theatricals.</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>finishing ball of worsted</i>). That will do:
thank you. Do not let me detain you: I know you
are in a hurry.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> I have my work to do.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> So it seems; and it takes all day and half the
night.</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>rising and going to fireplace</i>). I am working
hard for our future happiness.</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>quietly</i>). I should like a little of the happiness
now.</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>standing with back to fireplace</i>). Are you unhappy?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Oh no&mdash;not very.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Do you not have everything you wish?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Oh yes&mdash;except the one thing I want most.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Well, my dear, I am at home as much as I can
be.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> So you think I meant you?</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>embarrassed</i>). Well&mdash;I did suppose&mdash;that&mdash;</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Yes, I used to want you. The days were
long enough while you were away, and I waited for
your return. Now I have been alone so much that I
am getting accustomed to solitude. And I do not
really know what it is I do want. I am listless, nervous,
good-for-nothing&mdash;</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>gallantly</i>). You are good enough for me.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> You did think so once; and perhaps you
would think so again&mdash;if you could spare the time
to get acquainted with me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>surprised</i>). Jenny, are you ill?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Not more so than usual. I was bright enough
two years ago, when we were married. But for two
years I have not lived, I have vegetated; more like a
plant than a human being; and even plants require
some sunshine.</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>aside</i>). I have never heard her talk like this
before. I don’t understand it.&mdash;(<i>Aloud.</i>) Why,
Jenny, you speak as if I were a cloud over your
life.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Do I? Well, it does not matter.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> I try to be a good husband, don’t I?</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>indifferently</i>). As well as you know how, I
suppose.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Do I deprive you of anything you want?</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>impatiently</i>). Of course you do not.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> I work hard, I know, but when I go out in the
evening now and then&mdash;</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>aside</i>). Six nights every week. (<i>Sighing.</i>)</p>

<p><i>He.</i> I really work. There are husbands who say
they are at work when they are at the club playing
poker: now I am really working.</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>impatiently</i>). You have no small vices. (<i>Rising.</i>)
Is there no work calling you away to-night?
Why are you not off?</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>looking at watch</i>). I am a little late, that’s a
fact: still, I can do what I have to do if I work like a
horse.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Have you to draw a conveyance? That is the
old joke.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> This is no joke. It’s a divorce suit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>quickly</i>). Is it that Lightfoot person again?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> It is Mrs. Lightfoot’s case. She is a very fine
woman, and her husband has treated her shamefully.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Better than the creature deserved, I dare say.
You will win her case for her?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> I shall do my best.</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>sarcastically</i>). No doubt.&mdash;(<i>Aside.</i>) I hate
that woman! (<i>Crosses the room and sits on sofa on
the right of the fireplace.</i>)</p>

<p><i>He.</i> But the result of a lawsuit is generally a toss-up;
and heads do not always win.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> I wish you luck this time&mdash;for her husband’s
sake: he’ll be glad to be rid of her. But I doubt it:
you can’t get up any sympathy by exhibiting her to
the jury: she isn’t good-looking enough.</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>quickly</i>). She’s a very fine woman indeed.</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>aside</i>). How eagerly he defends her!&mdash;(<i>Aloud.</i>)
She’s a great big, tall, giantess creature,
with a face like a wax doll and a head of hair like a
Circassian Girl. No juryman will fall in love with
her.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> How often have I told you that Justice does
not consider persons! Now, in the eye of the law&mdash;</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). Do you acknowledge that the
law has but one eye and can see only one side?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Are you jealous? (<i>Crossing and standing in
front of her.</i>)</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Jealous of this Mrs. Lightfoot? (<i>Laughs.</i>)
Ridiculous!</p>

<p><i>He.</i> I am glad of it, for I think a jealous woman
has a very poor opinion of herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>forcibly</i>). And it is her business which takes
you out to-night?</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>going toward the left-hand door</i>). I have to go
across to the Bar Association to look up some points,
and&mdash;</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>rising quickly</i>). And you can just send me a
cab. I shall go to Mrs. Playfair’s to rehearse again
for the private theatricals.</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>annoyed, coming back</i>). But I had asked you
to give it up.</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>with growing excitement</i>). And I had almost
determined to give it up, but I have changed my mind.
That’s a woman’s privilege, isn’t it? I am tired of
spending my evenings by myself.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Now be reasonable, Jenny: I must work.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> And I must play&mdash;in the private theatricals.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> But I don’t like private theatricals.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Don’t you? I do.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> And I particularly dislike amateur actors.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Do you? I don’t. I like some of them very
much; and some of them like me, too.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> The deuce they do!</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Tom Thursby and Dick Carey and Harry
Wylde were all disputing who should make love to
me.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Make love to you?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> In the play&mdash;in <cite>Husbands and Wives</cite>.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Do you mean to say that you are going to act
on the stage with those brainless idiots?</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). Do not call my friends names:
it is in bad taste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p><i>He.</i> What will people say when they see my wife
pawed and clawed by those fellows?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Let them say what they please. Do you think
I care for the tittle-tattle of the riffraff of society?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> But, Jenny&mdash;(<i>Brusquely.</i>) Confound it!
I have no patience with you!</p>

<p><i>She.</i> So I have discovered. But you need not lose
your temper here, and swear. Go outside and do it,
and leave me alone, as I am every evening.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> You talk as if I ill-treated you.</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>sarcastically</i>). Do I? That is very wicked of
me, isn’t it? You take the best possible care of me,
you are ever thinking of me, and you never leave my
side for a moment. Oh no, you do not ill-treat me&mdash;or
abuse me&mdash;or neglect me (<i>breaking down</i>)&mdash;or
make me miserable. There is nothing the matter with
me, of course. But you never will believe I have a
heart until you have broken it! (<i>Sinking on chair, C.</i>)</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>crossing to her</i>). You are excited, I see; still,
I must say this is a little too much.</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>starting up</i>). Don’t come near me! (<i>Sarcastically.</i>)
Don’t let me keep you from your work (<i>going
to door R. 2d E</i>), and don’t fail to send me a cab. At
last I revolt against your neglect.</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>indignantly protesting</i>). My neglect? Do you
mean to say I neglect you? My conscience does not
reproach me.</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>at the door on the right</i>). That’s because you
haven’t any! (<i>Exit, slamming door</i>).</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>alone</i>). I never saw her go on that way before.
What can be the matter with her? She is not like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
herself at all: she is low-spirited and nervous. Now,
I never could see why women had any nerves. I wonder
if she really thinks that I neglect her? I should
be sorry, very sorry, if she did. I’ll not go out to-night:
I’ll stay at home and have a quiet evening at my own
fireside. (<i>Sits in chair in the centre.</i>) I think that
will bring her round. I’d like to know what has made
her act like this. Has she been reading any sentimental
trash, I wonder? (<i>Sees book in work-basket.</i>) Now,
here’s some yellow-covered literature. (<i>Takes it up.</i>)
Why, it’s that confounded play, <cite>Husbands and Wives</cite>.
Let me see the silly stuff. (<i>Reads:</i>) “My darling, one
more embrace, one last, long, loving kiss;” and then
he hugs her and kisses her. (<i>Rising.</i>) And she
thinks I’ll have her play a part like that? How should
I look while that was going on? Can’t she find something
else? (<i>At work-table.</i>) Here is another. (<i>Takes
up second pamphlet.</i>) No, it is a <cite>Guide to the Passions</cite>.
I fear I need no guide to get into a passion. I
doubt if there’s as much hugging and kissing in this as
in the other one. (<i>Reads:</i>) “It is impossible to describe
all the effects of the various passions, but a few
hints are here given as to how the more important may
be delineated.” (<i>Spoken.</i>) This is interesting. If
ever I have to delineate a passion I shall fall back on
this guide. (<i>Reads:</i>) “Love is a&mdash;” (<i>Reads hastily
and unintelligibly:</i>) “When successful, love authorizes
the fervent embrace of the beloved!” The deuce
it does! And I find my wife getting instruction from
this Devil’s text-book! A little more and I should be
jealous. (<i>Looks at book.</i>) Ah, here is jealousy: now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
let’s see how I ought to feel. (<i>Reads:</i>) “Jealousy is
a mixture of passions and&mdash;” (<i>Reads hastily and
unintelligibly.</i>) Not so bad! I believe I could act up
to these instructions. (<i>Jumping up.</i>) And I will!
My wife wants acting: she shall have it! She complains
of monotony: she shall have variety! “Jealousy
is a mixture of passions.” I’ll be jealous: I’ll give
her a mixture of passions. I’ll take a leaf out of her
book, and I’ll find a cure for these nerves of her’s. I’ll
learn my part at once: we’ll have some private theatricals
to order. (<i>Walks up and down, studying
book.</i>)</p>

<p class="center smaller"><i>She re-renters, with bonnet on and cloak over her arm, and stands in
surprise, watching him.</i></p>

<p><i>She.</i> You here still?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Have you ordered a cab for me?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> And why not?</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>aside</i>). Now’s my chance. Mixture of passions&mdash;I’ll
try suspicion first.&mdash;(<i>Aloud.</i>) Because I
do not approve of the people you are going to meet&mdash;these
Thursbys and Careys and Wyldes.</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>calmly sitting on sofa</i>). Perhaps you would
like to revise my visiting-list, and tell the servant whom
I am to receive.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> You may see what ladies you please&mdash;</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). Thank you; still, I do not please
to see Mrs. Lightfoot.</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>annoyed</i>). I say nothing of her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p><i>She.</i> Oh dear, no! I dare say you keep it as secret
as you can.</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>aside</i>). Simple suspicion is useless. What’s
next? (<i>Glances in pamphlet:</i>) “Peevish personalities.”
I will pass on to peevish personalities.&mdash;(<i>Aloud.</i>)
Now, these men, these fellows who strut about the
stage for an idle hour, who are they? This Tom
Thursby, who wanted to make love to you&mdash;who
is he?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Are you going to ask many questions? Is
this catechism a long one? If it is, I may as well lay
aside my shawl.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Who is he, I say, I insist upon knowing.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> He’s a good enough fellow in his way.</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>sternly</i>). He had best beware how he gets in
<em>my</em> way.</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>aside</i>). There’s a great change in his manner:
I do not understand it.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> And this Dick Carey&mdash;who is he? (<i>Stalking
toward her.</i>)</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>starting up and crossing</i>). Are you trying to
frighten me by this violence?</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>aside</i>). It is producing an effect.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> But I am not afraid of you, if I am a weak
woman and you are a strong man.</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>aside</i>). It is going all right.&mdash;(<i>Aloud, fiercely.</i>)
Answer me at once! Is this Carey married?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> I believe he is.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> You believe! Don’t you know? Does his
wife act with these strollers? Have you not seen
her?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p><i>She.</i> I have never seen her. She and her husband
are like the two buckets in a well: they never turn up
together. They meet only to clash, and one is always
throwing cold water on the other.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> And Harry Wylde! Is he married?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Yes; and his wife is always keeping him in
hot water.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> And so he comes to you for consolation?</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>laughing</i>). He needs no consoling: he has
always such a flow of spirits.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> I’ve heard the fellow drank.</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>surprised, aside</i>). Can Jack be jealous? I
wish I could think so, for then I might hope he still
loved me.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> And do you suppose I can allow you to associate
with these fellows, who all want to make love
to you?</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>aside, joyfully</i>). He <em>is</em> jealous! The dear
boy!</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>fiercely</i>). Do you think I can permit this,
madam?</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>aside</i>). “Madam!” I could hug him for loving
me enough to call me “madam” like that. But I
must not give in too soon.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Have you nothing to say for yourself? Can
you find no words to defend yourself, woman?</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>aside</i>). “Woman!” He calls me “woman!”
I can forgive him anything now.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Are you dumb, woman? Have you naught to
say?</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>gleefully, aside</i>). I had no idea I had married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
an Othello! (<i>She sees the pillow on the sofa, and,
crossing to it quietly, hides the pillow behind the sofa.</i>)</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>aside</i>). What did she mean by that?&mdash;(<i>Aloud,
fiercely.</i>) Do you intend to deny&mdash;</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). I have nothing to deny, I have
nothing to conceal.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Do you deny that you confessed these fellows
sought to make love to you?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> I do not deny that. (<i>Mischievously.</i>) But
I never thought you would worry about such trifles.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Trifles! madam? Trifles, indeed! (<i>Glances
in book, and quoting:</i>)</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Trifles light as air</div>
<div class="verse">Are to the jealous confirmations strong</div>
<div class="verse">As proofs of holy writ.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>surprised aside</i>). Where did he get his blank
verse?</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>aside</i>). That seemed to tell. I’ll give her
some more. (Glancing in pamphlet, and quoting:)</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“But, alas, to make me</div>
<div class="verse">A fixed figure for the time of scorn</div>
<div class="verse">To point his slow, unmoving finger at!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>aside, jumping up with indignation</i>). Why, it
is <cite>Othello</cite> he is quoting! He is acting! He is positively
playing a part! It is shameful of him! It’s
not real jealousy: it’s a sham. Oh, the wretch! But
I’ll pay him back! I’ll make him jealous without any
make-believe.</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>aside</i>). I’m getting on capitally. I’m making
a strong impression: I am rousing her out of her nervousness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
I doubt if she will want any more private
theatricals now. I don’t think I shall have to repeat
the lesson. This <cite>Guide to the Passions</cite> is a first-rate
book: I’ll keep one in the house all the time.</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>aside</i>). If he plays Othello, I can play Iago.
I’ll give his jealousy something to feed on. I have no
blank verse for him, but I’ll make him blank enough
before I am done with him. Oh, the villain!</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>aside</i>). Now let me try threatening. (<i>Glancing
in book:</i>) “Pity the sorrows of a poor old man”&mdash;I’ve
got the wrong place. That’s not threatening&mdash;that’s
senility. (<i>Turning over page.</i>) Ah, here
it is.</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>aside</i>). And he thinks he can jest with a
woman’s heart and not be punished? Oh, the wickedness
of man!&mdash;(<i>Forcibly.</i>) Oh, if mamma were only
here, now!</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>threateningly</i>). Who are these fellows? This
Tom, Dick and Harry are&mdash;are they&mdash;(<i>hesitates, and
glances in pamphlet</i>) are they “framed to make women
false?”</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>aside</i>). Why, he’s got a book! It’s my
<cite>Guide to the Passions</cite>. The wretch has actually been
copying his jealousy out of my own book. (<i>Aloud,
with pretended emotion.</i>) Dear me, Jack, you never
before objected to my little flirtations. (<i>Aside, watching
him.</i>) How will he like that?</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>aside, puzzled</i>). “Little flirtations!” I don’t
like that&mdash;I don’t like it at all.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> They have all been attentive, of course&mdash;</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>aside</i>). “Of course!” I don’t like that, either.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p><i>She.</i> But I did not think you would so take to
heart a few innocent endearments.</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>starting</i>). “Innocent endearments!” Do you
mean to say that they offer you any “innocent endearments?”</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>quietly</i>). Don’t be so boisterous, Jack: you
will crush my book.</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>looking at pamphlet crushed in his hand, and
throwing it from him, aside</i>). Confound the book! I
do not need any prompting now.&mdash;(<i>Aloud.</i>) Which
of these men has dared to offer you any “innocent
endearments?”</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>hesitatingly</i>). Well&mdash;I don’t know&mdash;that I
ought to tell you&mdash;since you take things so queerly.
But Tom&mdash;</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>forcibly</i>). Tom?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Mr. Thursby, I mean. He and I are very old
friends, you know&mdash;I believe we are third cousins or
so&mdash;and of course I don’t stand on ceremony with
him.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> And he does not stand on ceremony with you,
I suppose?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Oh, no. In fact, we are first-rate friends.
Indeed, when Dick Carey wanted to make love to me,
he was quite jealous.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Oh, <em>he</em> was jealous, was he? The fellow’s impudence
is amazing! When I meet him I’ll give him
a piece of my mind.</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>demurely</i>). Are you sure you can spare it!</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Don’t irritate me too far, Jenny: I’ve a temper
of my own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p><i>She.</i> You seem to have lost it now.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Do you not see that I am in a heat about this
thing? How can you sit there so calmly? You keep
cool like a&mdash;(<i>hesitates</i>) like a&mdash;</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). Like a burning-glass, I keep
cool myself while setting you on fire? Exactly so, and
I suppose you would prefer me to be a looking-glass in
which you could see only yourself?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> A wife should reflect her husband’s image, and
not that of a pack of fools.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Come, come, Jack, you are not jealous?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> “Jealous!” Of course I am not jealous, but
I am very much annoyed.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> I am glad that you are not jealous, for I have
always heard that a jealous man has a very poor opinion
of himself.&mdash;(<i>Aside.</i>) There’s one for him.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> I am not jealous, but I will probe this thing to
the bottom; I must know the truth.</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>aside</i>). He <em>is</em> jealous now; and this is real: I
am sure it is.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Go on, tell me more: I must get at the bottom
facts. There’s nothing like truth.</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>aside</i>). There is nothing like it in what he’s
learning.</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>aside</i>). This Carey is harmless enough, and he
can’t help talking. He’s a&mdash;he’s a telescope; you
have only to draw him out, and anybody can see
through him. I’ll get hold of him, draw him out, and
then shut him up! (<i>Crossing excitedly.</i>)</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>aside</i>). How much more his real jealousy
moves me than his pretence of it! He seems very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
much affected: no man could be as jealous as he is
unless he was very much in love.</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>with affected coolness</i>). You have told me
about Tom and Dick; pray, have you nothing to say
about Harry?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Mr. Wylde? (<i>Enthusiastically.</i>) He is a
man after my own heart!</p>

<p><i>He.</i> So he is after it? (<i>Savagely.</i>) Just let me
get after him!</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>coolly</i>). Well, if you do not like his attentions,
you can take him apart and tell him so.</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>vindictively</i>). If I took him apart he’d never
get put together again!</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Mr. Wylde is very much afraid of his wife,
but when she is not there he is more devoted than
either of the others.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> “More devoted!” What else shall I hear,
I wonder?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> It was he who had to kiss me.</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>startled</i>). What?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> I told him not to do it. I knew I should
blush if he kissed me: I always do.</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>in great agitation</i>). You always do? Has this
man ever&mdash;(<i>breaking down.</i>) Oh, Jenny! Jenny!
you do not know what you are doing. I do not blame
you&mdash;it is not your fault: it is mine. I did not know
how much I loved you, and I find it out now, when it
is perhaps too late.</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>aside</i>). How I have longed for a few words
of love like these! and they have come at last!</p>

<p><i>He.</i> I have been too selfish; I have thought too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
much of my work and too little of your happiness. I
see now what a mistake I have made.</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>aside</i>). I cannot sit still here and see him
waste his love in the air like this.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> I shall turn over a new leaf. If you will let
me I shall devote myself to you, taking care of you and
making you happy.</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>aside</i>). If he had only spoken like that before!</p>

<p><i>He.</i> I will try to win you away from these associates:
I am sure that in your heart you do not care for them.
(<i>Crossing to her.</i>) You know that I love you: can I not
hope to win you back to me?</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>aside</i>). Once before he spoke to me of his
love: I can remember every tone of his voice, every
word he said.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Jenny, is my task hopeless?</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>quietly crossing to arm-chair</i>). The task is
easy, Jack. (<i>Smiling.</i>) Perhaps you think too much
of these associates: perhaps you think a good deal
more of them than I do. In fact, I am sure that to-night
you were the one who took to private theatricals
first. By the way, where’s my <cite>Guide to the Passions</cite>?
Have you seen it lately?</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>half comprehending</i>). Your <cite>Guide to the Passions</cite>?
A book with a yellow cover? I think I <em>have</em>
seen it.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> I saw it last in your hand&mdash;just after you
had been quoting <cite>Othello</cite>.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> <cite>Othello?</cite> Oh, then you know&mdash;</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>smiling</i>). Yes, I know. I saw, I understood,
and I retaliated on the spot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p><i>He.</i> You retaliated?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> I paid you off in your own coin&mdash;counterfeit,
like yours.</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>joyfully</i>). Then Tom did not make love to you?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Oh, yes he did&mdash;in the play.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> And Dick is not devoted?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Yes, he is&mdash;in the play.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> And Harry did not try to kiss you?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Indeed he did&mdash;in the play.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Then you have been playing a part?</p>

<p><i>She.</i> Haven’t you?</p>

<p><i>He.</i> Haven’t I? Certainly not. At least&mdash;Well,
at least I will say nothing more about Tom or Dick or
Harry.</p>

<p><i>She.</i> And I will say nothing more of Mrs. Lightfoot.</p>

<p><i>He</i> (<i>dropping in chair to her right</i>). Mrs. Lightfoot
is a fine woman, my dear (<i>she looks up</i>), but she
is not my style at all. Besides, you know, it was only
as a matter of business, for the sake of our future prospects,
that I took her part.</p>

<p><i>She</i> (<i>throwing him skein of wool</i>). And it is only
for the sake of our future happiness that I have been
playing mine.</p>

<h2>Stories by American Authors</h2>

<div class="bt bb">

<p>“A brilliant series.”&mdash;<cite>Boston Courier.</cite></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Messrs. Charles Scribner’s Sons</span> have in hand a
publication of unusual importance and interest, in the volumes
of “Stories by American Authors,” of which they have just
begun the issue.</p>

<p>The books carry their sufficient explanation in their brief
title. They are collections of the more noteworthy short
stories contributed by American writers during the last
twenty-five years&mdash;and especially during the last ten&mdash;either
to periodicals or publications now for some reason not easily
accessible.</p>

<p>It is surprising that such a collection has not been attempted
earlier, in view of the extraordinarily large proportion
of strong work in American fiction which has been cast
in the form of the short story.</p>

<p>If the publishers of the present collection are right, it will
not only show the remarkably large number of contemporary
American authors who have won general acknowledgment
of their excellence in this field, but will surprise most readers
by the number of capital and striking stories by less frequent
writers, which are scattered through our recent periodical
literature.</p>

<p>In England, in the well-known “Tales from Blackwood,”
the experiment was tried of publishing such stories taken from
a single magazine within a limited time. But the noticeable
feature of the present volumes will be seen to be the extent
of the field from which they draw, and their fully representative
character.</p>

<p>“Mr. Brander Matthews’s studies are made with intelligence and conscientiousness.
The characteristics of the work of noted stage-writers, from Hugo
to M. Zola, are carefully presented in an entertaining way, while the personality
and life of each are not neglected. There is no book from which the English
reader can obtain so trustworthy a view of the contemporary French
drama, and none surely in which a theme so complex is so pleasantly unfolded.
The analysis of the realistic school, its methods and aims, is, in spite of its
brevity, an excellent thing, excellently well done. The volume is made up in
a manner very creditable to the scholarly tastes of the author. A chronology
of the French drama is prefixed, there are valuable notes and references,
largely bibliographical, and a good index.”&mdash;<cite>Boston Traveller.</cite></p>

<p>“It is not often that we have in our hands a volume of
sweeter or more finished verses.… In choosing Love for a
conductor, who alone may open the way to Arcady, the poet
indicates the theme on which he sings best, and which reflects
at some angle, or repeats in some strain the inspiration of the
great poetic and dramatic passion of life. His poems are
thrown together in a delicately concealed order, which is just
perceptible enough to give an impression of progress and
movement.”&mdash;<cite>The Independent.</cite></p>

<p>“The book is a little treasury of refined thought, graceful

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
